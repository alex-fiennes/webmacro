WebMacro 2.0 1-November-2005
------------------------------
                    
This is WebMacro 2.0, a production release of WebMacro Version 2.  245 Unit Tests
have been executed against this release. All tests and source compile and run
against JDK 1.4 and 1.5. Exciting new features are in this release supporting
demanding text applications such as AJAX applications, code generation, and 
inversion of control.

We beleive this release to be very stable and many of us are using it in production
environments; however, you may find some bugs.  Please report bugs to our subscriber-only
mailing list.  Please visit http://www.webmacro.org/MailingList for details.

WM 2.0 includes new features such as #templet, #eval, and
#setproperty. Syntax-level map support and numerous bugfixes and improved web docs
are a part of the release.

The best place for information about WebMacro is our website:

This is a wiki site built from the ground up using WM.

WebMacro is managed at SourceForge (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/webmacro/).

Changes in this Release
-----------------------

- Some small signature changes to methods require you to recompile
source code which imports files from webmacro.jar, especially if you are upgrading
from a release prior to Version 2.0.

- WebMacro now has a dependency on Doug Lea's "concurrent.jar". WHEREVER
you deposit webmacro.jar, add concurrent.jar. This library is used internally 
by WebMacro to manage many of the concurrency issues inherent to
web development and execution.  Although "concurrent.jar" is included with WebMacro, you
can read about the library here:

    http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html

- WebMacro 2.0 now has first-class support for creating Maps:
    #set $foo = {"key" : "value", "key2" : "value", "keyN" : value }
Creating an empty map:
    #set $foo = { }
Map definitions can also span multiple lines:
    #set $foo = {"key" : "value",
                 "key2" : "value",
                 "keyN" : value }

- WebMacro improves support for inversion of control with #bean and #setprops:

Instead of:

#set $User.Name = "Joe Shmo"
#set $User.Address = "123 Any Street"
#set $User.Phone = "555.555.5555"
#set $User.Orders = 0
#set $User.Type = $User.TYPE_STANDARD

you can in release 2.0:

#setprops $User class="com.opendoors.entity.User" {
  Name = Joe Shmo
  Adress = 123 Any Street
  Phone = 555.555.5555
  Orders = 0
  Type = $User.TYPE_STANDARD
}

If $User is not in the context, a new instance of j.u.Hashtable will be created.

- WM is released in classic mode. An alternate mode exists: minimal.

Classic mode is for web deployments where you will be using WebMacro to assist in rendering
web pages. Many conveniences exist for your web applications with this configuration.

Minimal is when you are generating email, source code, XML documents and the like not
within a web servlet container. Use the classic mode for these kinds of tasks. 
Minimal is provided to avoid inclusion of web-based activities. To build the minimal mode,
set property, wm-style, in build.xml to "minimal" and then rebuild the distribution. 

Version 2 provides these features which further distinguish it from other
Java templating engines:

- A powerul new feature has been added allowing for blocks
to be created as templets and evaluated. This is addition to the
macro calling facility.

- In addition to WMServlet.java, a servlet TemplateServlet.java is
included. It shows how to improve performance by creating an
immutable global context which acts as a constants context for the life
of the application (or until it is refreshed). 

- Two utility classes in the package, org.webmacro.util, have been 
added/updated: WMStringEval.java and WMEval.java. These files expose
some of the features of WebMacro processing in a more intuitive fashion.

- Generally, this release represents a very stable runtime for
use as an embedded text processing engine in any context, web or otherwise.
