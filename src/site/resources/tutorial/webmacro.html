<h2>What is it?</h2>

WebMacro is a page generator which introspects ordinary Java
objects to extract their properties and drop them into a template. 
Typically you use it to create an HTML view of a set of Java objects.
<p>
You can use WebMacro under a Java servlet to generate HTML, XML, or 
other formats in response to web requests. You can also use WebMacro
offline to generate the same pages from a batch processing job: WebMacro
is not tied to the servlet API.

<h2>How does a programmer use it?</h2>

Here is the simplest way:
<pre>
   WebMacro wm = new WebMacro(); // probably just once in your servlet
   FastWriter out = new FastWriter(outStream); // create a FastWriter

   Context c = wm.getContext();  // do this every request
   c.put("query", queryString);  // put ordinary Java object: a string?
   Result[] res = ...;           // some data: maybe search results?
   c.put("results", res);        // put complex objects in here too!

   Template t = wm.getTemplate("search.view");
   t.write(out, context);
</pre>

The key steps here are: 
<ul>
  <li>Put your application data into a Context
  <li>Load a Template
  <li>write: WebMacro applies your Context to the Template 
</ul>

The most important point is that the objects you put into the 
context are plain, vanilla, ordinary Java objects: WebMacro 
performs class analysis to figure out how to extract the 
data required by the Template.
<p>
This means that as a programmer you concentrate on writing 
ordinary Java objects, without regard to how they are rendered
in the final page view. Your code looks and feels like what
it is: pure Java code.

<h2>How does a template writer use it?</h2>

Given the servlet code above, an over-simplified "search.view" might
look like this:
<pre>
  &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Search Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Here are the results for $query:&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;
  #foreach $result in $results {
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;$result.Number&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="$result.Link"&gt;$result.Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  }
  &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

The main point is that this is pretty much ordinary HTML. There is
an extremely simple scripting code here, but the logic relates to how
the page is going to look. Nothing in the template describes how 
the search result was obtained, nor is there any business logic
here. The logic on the page is page logic.
<p>

WebMacro would replace $queryString with the string you added to
the context. Next it would loop through the Result array looking
at each element and working out how to extract the properties 
"Name", "Number", and "Link" from whatever sort of objects 
happened to be in the array. 
<p>
WebMacro follows the JavaBeans standard when performing this 
analysis, and might find a result.Number field, a result.getLink() 
method, and perhaps might resort to result.get("Name") to extract
the Name field. The particulars would depend on the actual Java 
definition of the Result class.
