<p>
WebMacro is an opensource development project. That has 
three important implications for you:
<ul>
  <li>You get all the source code 
  <li>There is an active mailing list where you can get help
  <li>If you get involved, you might even become a developer!
</ul>

At any rate, the place to start learning about WebMacro is
definately the website itself.

<h2>webmacro list</h2>

You might consider joining and participating in the WebMacro
mailing list. Either follow the links to it from the WebMacro
website, or send mail to webmacro-request@webmacro.org to join.

questions on the mailing list.

<h2>The JavaDoc API</h2>

WebMacro ships with a README and some other documentation, but 
the primary documentation continues to the the JavaDoc. WebMacro
is largely a library, and it is best documented through its API.
