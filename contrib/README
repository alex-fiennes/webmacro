WebMacro Contributions:

The applications in this area are contributions which are supported, if at
all, by their authors. They are not part of the WebMacro core, though they 
might prove to be very useful :-) 

If you have a contribution you would like to submit to this area, you can
by simply setting your CVSROOT to:

    CVSROOT=:pserver:wm@cvs.webmacro.org:/root
    cvs login  <password="webmacro">
    cvs checkout wmcontrib 

Please notify the WebMacro mailing list (webmacro@semiotek.com) of your 
contributions.  Also, please be very considerate of the files in /wmcontrib
and only remove *your* files.  If at any point you are not sure what to do,
ASK THE LIST!  Somebody there will be glad to help.

Your contribution must be opensource under some opensource license.
