I have written a tool called ContextDebugger that once registered as a tool can 
be called via $ContextDebugger. This will dump out The countents of the 
context. This will list all the keys, objects and object types. Also it will 
dump out the contexts of the HTTPSession, Any Cookies, Parameters RequestInfo 
etc. I hope it is useful to anyone. You are welcome to use it.
