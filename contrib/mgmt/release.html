The examples directory contains some useful files in understanding
how to use the management contribution as it pertains to Object Relational
Mapping. This module is a work in process.
<p>
src/o/w/mgmt/impl contains some useful servlets. In particular, if you
want to use this module out of the box, configure the servlet, 
o.w.m.i.TemplateServlet.class, to handle *.tml files. Here is how my
resin configuration file handles this for a host section:
<pre>
  servlet-mapping url-pattern='*.tml' servlet-name='template'
  servlet servlet-name='template' servlet-class='org.webmacro.mgmt.impl.TemplateServlet'
</pre>


<h3>Object Relational Mapping and Code Generation</h3>
<p>
The management module contains an emerging platform for integrated data
model design, sql generation, and java source file generation.
<p>
The system has a couple of moving parts. However, if you have the "template"
servlet mentioned above serving up *.tml files, you will rock.
<p>
Run the example demo file <a href="examples/Credential.tml">Credential.tml</a>
to see the O/R mapping magic in action.
<ol>
<li>Copy Credential.tml to your document root.
<li>Be sure and copy mgmt.jar, resources.jar to your servlet lib directory.
<li>Restart your server.
<li>Point your browser to http://host/Credential.tml
</ol>
If you have configured this properly, you will get an output identical to
<a href="examples/Credential.txt">Credential.txt</a> in your browser.
<p>
The template magic is in <a href="templates/org/opendoors/store">this directory
</a>.
The source code magic is in 
<a href="src/org/opendoors/store/ORSchema.java">ORSchema.java</a>. The use
of static inner classes makes it possible to keep all the relations tightly
packed in a single file.
<p>
Enjoy.
