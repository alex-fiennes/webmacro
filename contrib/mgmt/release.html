<p>
This module contains a number of general management functions for WebMacro
template authors, java programmers, and database gurus.
<p> 
The examples directory contains some useful files in understanding
how to use the management contribution as it pertains to Object Relational
Mapping. This module is a work in process.
<p>
src/o/w/mgmt/impl contains some useful servlets. In particular, if you
want to use this module out of the box, configure the servlet, 
o.w.m.i.TemplateServlet.class, to handle *.tml files. Here is how my
resin configuration file handles this for a host section:
<pre>
  servlet-mapping url-pattern='*.tml' servlet-name='template'
  servlet servlet-name='template' servlet-class='org.webmacro.mgmt.impl.TemplateServlet'
</pre>
Any file served ending in .tml under the above will be processed by the above servlet. The servlet
places $Servlet in the context so that you can gain access to all the underlying methods
of the servlet class hierarchy which includes WMServlet.
<p>
o.w.m.i.ActionServlet is an action mapping servlet in which the template writer
controls the action. This allows the template writer to specify the action semantic
to handle for example forms handling and reduces the costs associated with
writing controller servlets.
<h3>Object Relational Mapping and Code Generation</h3>
<p>
The management module contains an emerging platform for integrated data
model design, sql generation, and java source file generation. This is the open source
version of this platform and not the commercial version.
<p>
The system has a couple of moving parts. However, if you have the "template"
servlet mentioned above serving up *.tml files, you will rock.
<p>
Run the example demo file <a href="examples/Credential.tml">Credential.tml</a>
to see the O/R mapping magic in action.
<ol>
<li>Copy Credential.tml to your document root.
<li>Be sure and copy mgmt.jar, resources.jar to your servlet lib directory.
<li>Restart your server.
<li>Point your browser to http://host/Credential.tml
</ol>
If you have configured this properly, you will get an output identical to
<a href="examples/Credential.txt">Credential.txt</a> in your browser.
<p>
The template magic is in <a href="templates/org/opendoors/store">this directory
</a>.
The source code magic is in 
<a href="src/org/opendoors/store/ORSchema.java">ORSchema.java</a>. The use
of static inner classes makes it possible to keep all the relations tightly
packed in a single file.
<p>
Enjoy.
