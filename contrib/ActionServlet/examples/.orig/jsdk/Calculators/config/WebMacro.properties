# LogLevel can be: ALL, DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR, or NONE
# in order of most information to least information displayed.
# The top level "LogLevel" setting controls the default log level
# for any log. You can set specific levels for individual log types
# by declaring a value for LogLevel.type. WebMacro itself has the
# following types of log messages:
#
#   log        the log system itself
#   wm         high level WebMacro behavior
#   servlet    the servlet framework
#   resource   things that load other things (eg: TemplateProvider)
#   context    setting and evaluating properties in a context
#   engine     messages about parsing and executing a tempalte
#
# There may be more types than that in your system, you can learn
# what they are by setting the log level for "log" to INFO.

# LogTraceExceptions causes exception stack traces to be included in the log,

# Uncomment the following to log to a file rather than stderr. If your 
# standard error writes to a useful log already, you don't need this,
# but many servlet runners simply eat standard error.
