Ant build

Suggest copying or symlinking build.sh & build.xml to webmacro root directory.  
Originally this worked from the current directory by setting basdir-"../.." but that 
doesn't work in IDE's supporting ant (like NetBeans).

If you want to change the build directory, either edit the "dest" property or run as, for example,

    $ build.sh -Ddest=/tmp/path

The same goes for any other properties.

See http://jakarta.apache.org for more information on ant.
