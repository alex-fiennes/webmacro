This is the beginnings of a #cache directive for WebMacro.

Although it really works, it lacks useful features like
expiration and domain segmentation.  

The internal cache structure is currently a synchronized Map.  
However, the cache backend should be configurable and be able
to use and of the available CacheManagers.  It should also
be able to segment a cache by broker.  Right now, all instances
of WebMacro share the same cache.

I'm hoping somebody from the WebMacro community will be
inspired by this directive and offer up some suggestions
to make it useable.
