<H2>About the DataTable Sample Application</H2>
<P>
The sample application uses a servlet named TableDemo.java which subclasses WMServlet and a template 
called TableDemo.wm.  It is designed to illustrate most of the features of 
the ResultSetDataTable.</P>
<P>The demo uses the <a href="http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/">hsql Database Engine</a> and 
the <a href="http://protomatter.sourceforge.net/">Protomatter</a> connection pooling software.  Both are pure-Java, open-source
products.  The data is from the sample database from the Hypersonic SQL demo.  
</P>
<P><b>To use the HypersonicSQL sample database</b> - Make sure the database is running in client/server
mode ("runServer"). Use the database manager application ("run DatabaseManager") and 
select from the menu "Option|Insert test data" to create the sample tables.
</P>
<P>
You can easily substitute any database and/or connection pool that works with JDBC.
</P>
<P><b>To get the demo working on your system</b> - you will either need to install the above packages, in addition
to WebMacro, or modify the code to work with your own database. 

Add the org.webmacro.datatable classes to your CLASSPATH and be sure to adjust the 
TemplatePath in the WebMacro.properties file to point to the location of TableDemo.wm and the sub-template, TableNav.wm.
</p>
<p>
The template uses a #use 'text' directive,
to escape the JavaScript code, so you may have to modify the syntax of that directive to match your WebMacro 
version.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Using your own database</b> - You will need to modify the JDBC connection code and the SQL in 
TableDemo.java, as well as the named column references in the template (e.g., $row.FIRSTNAME),
to match your own database.
