URLProvider Test Scripts

Require Mozilla Rhino Javascript engine.   No special reason, just that I use it a lot.

Run from the root webmacro directory as

    $ ./contrib/Tests/URLTemplateProvider/run.sh <scriptname.js>

I haven't upgraded them all yet, but the following work:

    1.  test.js - a basic test for TemplatePath=ignore:

    2.  classpath.js - tests classpath loading(TemplatePath=classpath:). The
        templates directory is added to the classpath. If you jar up the
        template directory to templates.jar  and add that to the classpath (see
        run.sh), that should test classpath loading from within Jars

    3.  A simple cache tester.  Loads a file, wait 0.5 secs, loads it again,
        waits 1.5 secs.  If TemplateExpireTime=1sec  then the template should
        only be reloaded the second time. [ At the time of writing the logging
        is broken so can't override the logging level to see the cache in
        action without getting lots of wierd errors. ]
