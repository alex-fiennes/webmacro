This directory contains external dependencies needed
to make WebMacro compile.

If you downloaded the source distribution and want things to compile, 
you'll need to download the dependencies yourself.  :)  They are:
   servlet-2.x.jar http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html

If you plan on using the unit tests, you'll also need these:
   junit_37.jar  http://www.junit.org/
   apache-regexp.jar http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/index.html 

If you plan on making changes to the parser, you'll want JavaCC:
