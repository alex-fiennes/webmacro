This directory contains external dependencies needed
to make WebMacro compile.

As of release 2.0, the dependencies are included to allow you
to compile WebMacro out of the box. You may want to alter the 
release versions but do so at your own risk:

The dependencies for compiling WM are:

   servlet-2.x.jar http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html

for unit testing:
   junit_37.jar  http://www.junit.org/
   apache-regexp.jar http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/index.html 

For making changes to the parser, you'll want JavaCC:
