<blockquote><b>Goal:</b> The goal of macros/ is to provide some standardized
manner for everyday tasks like merging common html text with common objects,
formatting html form control tags, and managing common page elements.<br>
  <br>
See <a href="http://www.webmacro.org/MacroDirective">http://www.webmacro.org/MacroDirective</a>
for the complete docs on how to create a macro.<br>
  <br>
If macros/ is in your classpath, the following statement:<br>
  <br>
#include as macro "allmacros.wmm"<br>
  <br>
will include all standard macros in the macros/ folder. Edit this file if
you want to make some of your own macros a standard.<br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>wmm is the convention for identifying a file containing macros.</li>
    <li>You do not have to use this library and you can copy it to another
location and hack it as you please.</li>
    <li>You can add your own folder, eg local/, and then include the macros
in this folder by editing allmacros.wmm.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
macros are used in 1.1. Release 1.2 will allow for automatic inclusion at
the configuration level.</blockquote>
