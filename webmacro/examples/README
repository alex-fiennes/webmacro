WebMacro Examples
=================

These trivial examples are intended to help you get started with 
WebMacro. We suggest you try the HelloWorld example first, as it
is the easiest to get going.

In each case you will find comments inside the .java file explaining
what the example is, and how to get it working.

Here is an overview:


   HelloWorld 
   ----------

   A servlet. Demonstrates the basic workings of WebMacro, with lots
   of comments explainig each step. Try installing this one first.


   GuestBook
   ---------

   A servlet. Intended to give you an application with several 
   different templates, so you can experiment with customizing it.
   Also shows WebMacro using and introspecting some ordinary objects.
 

   TestWM
   ------

   A handler. This is an alternate way of using WebMacro that may 
   be convenient to people who would like to build controller servlets
   from existing classes. A handler is an interface you can implement
   rather than subclassing WMServlet. But then configuration becomes
   slightly trickier.
