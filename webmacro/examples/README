WebMacro Examples
=================

These trivial examples are intended to help you get started with 
WebMacro. We suggest you try the HelloWorld example first, as it
is the easiest to get going.

In each case you will find comments inside the .java file explaining
what the example is, and how to get it working.

Here is an overview:


   HelloWorld 
   ----------

   A servlet. Demonstrates the basic workings of WebMacro, with lots
   of comments explainig each step. Try installing this one first.


   GuestBook
   ---------

   A servlet. Intended to give you an application with several 
   different templates, so you can experiment with customizing it.
   Also shows WebMacro using and introspecting some ordinary objects.
 

   Standalone
   ----------
   
   An advanced HelloWorld servlet that does *not* subclass WMServlet.  This
   example, although a servlet, manages it's own WebMacro instance internally.
   It also demonstrates how to create FastWriters, Contexts, and how to write
   Templates.  If you're trying to fit WebMacro into an existing servlet
   application, this example will be of the most benefit for you.


   NoServlet
   ---------

   A standalone command-line program which demonstrates how to create
   a WebMacro instance and a Context along with getting and writing
   a template.  If you plan on using WebMacro outside of a servlet
   environment, look here first!
