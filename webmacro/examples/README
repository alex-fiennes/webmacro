WebMacro Examples
=================

These trivial examples are intended to help you get started with 
WebMacro. We suggest you try the HelloWorld example first, as it
is the easiest to get going.

[NOTE: For information on getting the examples configured on your system see
the document CONFIGURING-EXAMPLES in the webroot directory of this
distribution or the Wiki page at http://www.webmacro.org/ConfiguringExamples] 

In each case you will find comments inside the .java file explaining
what the example is, and how to get it working.

Previous versions of WebMacro *required* you to customize the WebMacro.properties
file, espically the "TemplatePath" value.  This is no longer required!  In fact,
in most cases you don't even need a WebMacro.properties file!

Included in the webmacro.jar file is a file named "WebMacro.defaults".  This
file contains all the default configuration settings for WebMacro.  Should
you need to change a key/value, DO NOT change it in the WebMacro.defaults.
Create a new file, "WebMacro.properties", and put in it *only* the keys/values
you wish to change.  WebMacro first loads it's .defaults, then if it exists
loads WebMacro.properties overriding any values set by .defaults.

Also, you no longer need to specify a TemplatePath.  WebMacro, depending on your
execution environment, will automagically find your templates:

1) WM in standalone mode (ie, not in a servlet):
   If using the "new WM();" constructor, WebMacro will search for templates in
your system CLASSPATH

2) WM in a Servlet 2.0 environment (ie, Apache/JServ):
   WebMacro will search for templates in your servlet container CLASSPATH

3) WM in a Servlet >2.0 environment (ie, Turbine or Resin):
   WebMacro will search for templates in your "application directory".  This
means different things for different servlet runners, but will include either
your "htdocs" directory or your WEB-INF/ directory/.war file.


Below is an overview of the examples included with this release:

   HelloWorld 
   ----------

   A servlet. Demonstrates the basic workings of WebMacro, with lots
   of comments explainig each step. Try installing this one first.


   GuestBook
   ---------

   A servlet. Intended to give you an application with several 
   different templates, so you can experiment with customizing it.
   Also shows WebMacro using and introspecting some ordinary objects.
 
   Profile
   -------
   
   A servlet that illustrates how to use the #profile directive to time
   various operations in a WebMacro application.
   
   Standalone
   ----------
   
   An advanced HelloWorld servlet that does *not* subclass WMServlet.  This
   example, although a servlet, manages it's own WebMacro instance internally.
   It also demonstrates how to create FastWriters, Contexts, and how to write
   Templates.  If you're trying to fit WebMacro into an existing servlet
   application, this example will be of the most benefit for you.

   Sandbox
   -------
   
   A servlet.  This is basically another version of the HelloWorld servlet.
   It is provided as a place where you can start playing with WebMacro by
   just editing the template -- sandbox.wm -- and the servlet Sandbox.java.
   Have fun exploring.

   NoServlet
   ---------

   A standalone command-line program which demonstrates how to create
   a WebMacro instance and a Context along with getting and writing
   a template.  If you plan on using WebMacro outside of a servlet
   environment, look here first!
