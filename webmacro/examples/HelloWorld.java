  * HelloWorld -- the simplest possible WebMacro servlet.
  * The easiest way to create a WebMacro servlet is to
  * subclass from org.webmacro.servlet.WMServlet
  *
  * Before trying to run this example, be sure to do
  * all of the following:
  *
  *   1.  Add webmacro.jar to your CLASSPATH
  *
  *   2.  Compile this servlet and install it in your servlet directory
  *
  *   3.  Add webmacro.jar to your servlet runner's classpath,
  *       and put webmacro.properties in the same place
  *
  *   4.  Edit webmacro.properties to configure WebMacro for your setup
  *
  *   5.  Start your servlet runner
