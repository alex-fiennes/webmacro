<a href=list.tml>list.tml</a> Lists can be powerfully handled by getting to know the List 
Context Tool and its methods. Here is a simple example of transforming default arrays to more powerful
lists implementing the java.util.List interface and thus being uniformly managed by the List Tool.
 
<a href=wizard.tml>wizard.tml</a> An example of how to render a form relying exclusively on introspection
obtain the "View", the labels, the controls, the values. Labels are rendered in a locale sensitive manner:
<pre>
$field.MetaField.getLabel($User.Locale):
</pre>
achieves label localization in the WM script.

<a href=wizardform.tml>wizardform.tml</a> An example of to interact with server state variables
and then how to evaluate conditions and parse in the correct template.

<a href=wizardform.tml>wizardform.tml</a> An example of to interact with server state variables

<p>
<a href=view.tml>view.tml</a> An example of a complete object report showing the "peers" of a logical
view. In most web apps, views will be linked together as logical pages.

<a href=View.java>View.java</a> An interface definition which 
represents the server-side equivalent of a webmacro "skin".
During template evaluation, an instance implementing this interface provides the core
lifecylce and state management methods. A convenient and globally unique identifier
can be passed around as an http get and post parameter. Views are often chained
together to produce wizards and multi-phased input models. State is always maintained
inside the View implementation members.
 
<p>
<a href=ViewFactory.java>ViewFactory.java</a> Views are instantiated by factories which return an instance implementing the View interface.

<p>
<a href=GeneralView.java>GeneralView.java</a> A view factory which supports multiple panels in a view.

<p>
<a href=GeneralCommitView.java>GeneralCommitView.java</a> A view factory which adds a commit view panel as the last view.

<p>
<a href=ReferralView.java>ReferralView.java</a> A concrete view containing two panels. The first allows for the panel
to create and manage a vector of elements. The second panel is for a single element.
The last panel is for a commit/confirmation of the views. This is an excellent example of how the subclass
has been relieved of all complexity in the view management. It is focused on the application elements
of the referred parties and the referring party.

<p>
<a href=ViewActionHandler.java>ViewActionHandler.java</a> You must add to a view one or more action handlers. The general case.

<p>
<a href=CommitActionHandler.java>CommitActionHandler.java</a> The base handler for the proverbial "OK. Do something with this input!"

<p>
<a href=InsertInterimBOHandler.java>InsertInterimBOHandler.java</a> A commit handler which
assembles the view elements and creates a persistent business object, an InterimBusinessObject. These
objects are persisted as elements in a <a href=http://engineering.acctiva.org>Very Large Hashtable</a>.
