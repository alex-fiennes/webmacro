WebMacro usage examples
</h2>
<h4 align="center">Last Updated 19-Mar-2008</h4>
<p>
These examples provide advanced usage of WebMacro and features in Release 2.
</p>
<p>
However, they provide a great insight into how WebMacro can be used to create
text applications, web pages, source files, xml, and other text-based files. 
</p>
<p>
<a href=list.tml>list.tml</a> Lists can be powerfully handled by getting to know the List 
Context Tool and its methods. Here is a simple example of transforming default arrays to more powerful
lists implementing the java.util.List interface and thus being uniformly managed by the List Tool.

<p>
<em>
The following examples are displayed for illustration but require other machinery 
to actually be in place to be rendered.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<a href=wizard.tml>wizard.tml</a> An example of how to render a form relying exclusively on 
introspection to obtain the "View", the labels, the controls, the values. 
Labels are rendered in a locale sensitive manner:
<pre>
$field.MetaField.getLabel($User.Locale):
</pre>
achieves label localization in the WM script.

<p>
<a href=wizardform.tml>wizardform.tml</a> An example of interacting with server state variables
and how to evaluate conditions and parse in the correct template.
</p>
<p>
<a href=view.tml>view.tml</a> An example of a complete object report showing the "peers" of a logical
view. In most web apps, views will be linked together as logical pages.
