<html><head><title>Hello, World!</title></head>

##  You have to set the content type. You could do this from
##  the servlet instead--but this way your page designer can 
##  change it if XML was wanted. What the line below does is 
##  use WebMacro's introspection to find and use the method:
##
##     WebContext.getResponse().setContentType("text/html")

#set $Response.ContentType = "text/html"

## Now the rest of your HTML, including a few example WebMacro 
## statements, just for fun. Note the use of the $Hello variable
## which is defined in the HelloWorld servlet.

<h1>WebMacro is working!</h1>
<ul>
#set $go = "<font color=red size=+1><b>$Hello</b></font>"
#foreach $count in [ five four three two one $go ] {
    <li>$count
}
</ul>

Thanks for looking into WebMacro!
