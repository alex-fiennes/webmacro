<h1><font color="green">Other Tools: Why aren't we just using X?</font></h1>

Another way to put it is, what's so different about WebMacro?
<p>
There are lots of tools out there that are similar, but different: This
page explains why we developed this product instead of using each of the
following products.
<p>
My purpose here is not to start a war. Each of these technologies is 
appropriate to a particular purpose--I wrote this document largely as an 
exercise for myself, to ensure that we weren't duplicating an existing
tool.
<p>
This document will help you figure out the niche that WebMacro fills 
in the server side tools landscape, by showing you how it is different
than other tools.

<h3><font color="green">Java Server Pages</font></h3>

WebMacro is very similar in concept to JavaSoft's JavaServer Pages (JSP) and 
template language. There are free software implementations of JSP available
as well: GnuJSP and Gnu Server Pages.
<p>
<p>The fundamental difference between our approach and theirs is that we have 
worked with SGML and XML too long to see it bastardized; and we think that
scripts written in XML markup are cluttered and hard to read.
<p>
The WebMacro template language has been designed to be orthagonal
to HTML/XML/SGML markup: you can stick it in a document without
violating the standard. It also has a comparatively compact syntax.
<p>
JSP does have the advantage of being more standard than our approach, mostly
owing to the fact that Sun is a very big company. On the other hand, WebMacro
will interoperate with Java Beans, and JSP is built around this idea as well.
Thus WebMacro scripts will interoperate with the raft of JSP beans that 
people will develop over the next while.
<p>
It comes down to whether you prefer our compact and XML friendly syntax 
or the verbose, non-standard (from an XML worldview) JSP syntax. 

<p>

<h3><font color="green">Apache JServ Templates</font></h3>

There's a good template package available as part of the Java-Apache
project.
<p>
It has less verbose syntax than Sun's JSP templates. It also uses
the &lt;% ... %&gt; markup. 
<p>
For looping Apache JServ templates, like WebMacro eliminated the concept
of an iterator and uses a looping structure called a "dataset" that
repeatedly applies itself to a block. The syntax for this in JServ
is much more compact and clear than in JSP.
<p>
We chose not to use this for primarily for the same reasons as JSP: 
Using tags to delimit the structure puts limits on what you can express
with clarity. Your tags are not as visually distinct from the surrounding
text, are more verbose. 
<p>
There is also a problem of substituting values within 
the CDATA section of an attribute. It becomes difficult to create valid
XML documents. In general trying to use a programming syntax that appears
to be too similar to the text it's embedded into seems to create some 
readability problems.
<p>

<h3><font color="green">Server Side EcmaScript/JavaScript</font></h3>

Like the WebMacro langauge, server side EcmaScript/JavaScript implementations
work on the theory that you should have a template into which you stick 
simple programming language statements.
<p>
Unfortunately the EcmaScript/JavaScript idea of "simple" is fairly complex
if you are a graphics designer--it looks and feels like a full fledged 
programming langauge, because it is one. 
<p>
Also, most of the JavaScript statements cannot easily be embedded in HTML. 
There are too many conflicts between the JavaScript language and HTML, so
most of the JavaScript ends up in a separate block. 
<p>
The EcmaScript/JavaScript approach is likely to suit you if you want to 
be a programmer and a web designer at the same moment in time. If you are
like most people, though, you probably switch gears when you move from 
analytical programming to artistic creation.
<p>
And of course our approach is much better suited to you if you are really
a team of people, some of whom are web site designers and some of whom 
are programmers.
<p>
With WebMacro we are not adverse to server-side JavaScript at all: we 
want to support it in a future version. However, we also want to keep 
it out of the web designer's face.

<p>

<h3><font color="green">Non-Java Tools</font></h3>

There are a ton: PHP, LiveScript, Oracle's server development toolkit, 
the very important embedded PERL script, and so on. 
<p>
I am not aware of any tools that have taken an approach exactly like ours
in other languages--but there are numerous good tools out there that 
solve the same problem.
<p>
Some of these have tried to invent new programming langauges for you 
to use (eg: PHP). These are full fledged specialized languages, but 
they are not as widespread or standard as Java/PERL/etc., and are not
as powerful as those languages either. 
<p>
Our appoach is to let you use a more powerful conventional langauge when
that is appropraite; the rest of the time we provide the glue that fits 
that together with the web page.
<p>
Some other technologies are actually more standard languages that have 
been embedded into web pages. Embedded PERL in particular is pretty
enticing--however it too is a non-web-design language stuck in the
graphics designers face: PERL can be a pretty messy thing for a  
non-programmer to have to read.
<p>
Also, perhaps you have chosen to use the WebMacro package because you
want to use Java on the server side. If you are looking for reasons
why you would want to develop in Java:
<ul>
  <li>It's a clean, robust, object oriented language that can scale up 
      to large project scope
  <li>It's very fast for an interpreted language, multi-threaded, 
      reliable, and safe
  <li>It's secure; you can install a rigorous security policy to 
      protect your servers from hostile users or even hostile servlet 
      authors!
  <li>There's a ton of tools available: a whole raft of "enterprise" 
      APIs, libraries, and toolkits for you to take advantage of, 
      including tons of database support, XML support, and so on. 
  <li>It's massively cross-platform, especially for server side 
      applications where messy Java GUI issues are irrelevant
  <li>Internationalization support is real--you can support all 
      languages, and all the built in Java libraries know it--from
      Unicode character sets right down to interoperability with
      different calendar systems.
</ul>

Of course here are some reasons why you might not want to use Java:

<ul>
  <li>Your project is due next week and you haven't learned Java yet
  <li>You have a huge code base already written in PERL and you aren't
      about to abandon it 
  <li>You are performing a specialized task and there is a language 
      that is ideally suited to that purpose.
  <li>Your boss told you to use Visual Basic, and though you really
      really hate it, you don't have a choice
</ul>

Well don't despair--WebMacro will not solve your problem <i>yet</i>,
but we are planning to. Future versions will include support for an
arbitrarily large number of langauges.
<p>
The core engine will still be based in a Java program--but we won't
let that stop us from interoperating with Perl, Python, Visual
Basic, JavaScript, and just about anything we can figure a way to
support.
<p>
We know that other languages are frequently better suited to a 
particular application, and we plan to support that. 
<p>
Right now, though, if you want to write Java code on the server side, 
and you don't want your web designer to see it--that's the main problem
we're here to solve.

<h3><font color="green">Drag'n'Drop Ra[bp]id development tools</font></h3>

Lots of vendors offer drag and drop tools for web page designers. The 
idea here is that by using a visual interface somehow the underlying 
complexity goes away. I have even seen langauges that take the extreme 
of trying to come up with visual metaphors for iteration and conditional
expressions.
<p>
In general I don't buy it. It's a hopeful idea, and if someone actually
makes it work effectively it'd be great.
<p>
But I am convinced that it is easier for a non-programmer to learn a very
small number of programming concepts (very small!) than to try and force
the current art of programming into a visual metaphor--and subject web page
designers to that like guinea pigs.
<p>
Our approach is to try and simplify programming constructs down, rather
than pretend they are not there. We have simple loops, simple conditionals,
and simple variable substitution.
<p>
We abandon concepts like "loop condition" in favour of the concept of 
walking through all the elements of a list. We hope that it is not too much
of a stretch for graphics designers to understand what a condition is, so long
as we don't resort to complicated boolean expressions.
<p>
The price you pay here is of course that your language is not powerful 
enough to satisfy a more advanced programmer. Our answer here has been to 
resort to a standard programming language like Java, in its own block, that
provides all the tools and power an advanced programmer would want.
<p>
We don't want to try and reinvent programming as a visual art any more 
than we want to try and re-invent Java, PERL, or anything else.
