<h1><font color="green">Other Tools: Why aren't we just using X?</font></h1>

Another way to put it is, what's so different about WebMacro?
<p>
There are lots of tools out there that are similar, but different: This
page explains why we developed this product instead of using each of the
following products.
<p>
My purpose here is not to start a war. Each of these technologies is 
appropriate to a particular purpose--I wrote this document largely as an 
exercise for myself, to ensure that we weren't duplicating an existing
tool.
<p>
This document will help you figure out the niche that WebMacro fills 
in the server side tools landscape, by showing you how it is different
than other tools.

<h3><font color="green">Java Server Pages</font></h3>

Java Server Pages are inappropriate for Java development. They're an 
attempt to woo ASP programmers to the Java platform by providing them 
with a familiar environment. Unfortunately that environment isn't a 
very good one, and doesn't fit with an object-oriented worldview. 
<p>
There are two basic problems with JSP:
<dl>
  <dt>(1) <b><font color="green">No clear design vision</font></b>
  <dd>A good design breaks work down into separate concerns. You can 
      then parallelize development and have different people work on 
      different parts. Each person can work independently, 
      <i>owning their own work</i>. You don't own your own work 
      when you have to work through someone else. For example, a 
      page designer does not own their own work if, in order to 
      modify the look of a page, they need the help of a programmer.
      <p>
      JSP views the separation of concerns in servlet development 
      like this: servlets are different from everything else. A 
      new, non-standard, non-Java environment is constructed (a 
      JSP page) in which you clutter HTML, servlet code, and 
      everything else it takes to build your servlet. Your 
      "ordinary" Java objects go elsewhere, as beans, which 
      you can inconveniently load into your page.
      <p>
      JSP's lack of design vision encourages you to throw all of 
      your code, your HTML, and everything else into the JSP page,
      with no clear separation. 
      <p>
      It's possible to separate out your concerns on your own, by 
      imposing self-discipline and constantly checking and monitoring
      the work done by people on your team. Unfortunately, without
      any support from the JSP framework errors creep in--business
      logic sneaks into a few pages, back-end beans begin to take
      on procedural programming APIs, and the coherency of your
      project suffers.
      <p>
      WebMacro separates your concerns into three distinct categories:
      servlet programming (you write a servlet), business logic
      development (you write Java beans), and template design. The
      fundamental idea behind WebMacro is that servlet programming
      is just like everything else: you want to write ordinary 
      looking program code in a standard pure-Java way. 
      <p>
      Your servlet code is simple, pure-Java code oriented around
      examining an incoming request and deciding how to deal with it.
      Your back-end code are ordinary Java beans representing the 
      object model that makes sense to your business. And your 
      templates on the front end are ordinary looking HTML pages,
      with no code or business logic, containing some WebMacro script
      directives.
      <p>
      This allows you to keep your code clean, simple, and pure, 
      and separate your development process into three parallel 
      efforts: template writers (who drive the look of your site), 
      servlet programmers (who manage connections with your users), 
      and core developers (who write the core logic behind your
      business into a set of Java beans).
      <p>
   </dd>
   <dt>(2) <b><font color="green">JSP is ugly</font></b>
   <dd>What you have to do in a JSP page in order to get the 
       output you want isn't pretty. Common operations like 
       repeating a block of text are uncommonly difficult. It's
       inconvenient to load in Java beans that you might want 
       to access. And you have to clutter up your JSP page with
       a bunch of Java code. 
       <p>
       I simply do not like the ASP model of placing ordinary 
       program code into an HTML document and pretending that 
       it's an adequate rendering language.
       <p>
       Contrast with WebMacro where a small but powerful set 
       of directives allow you to cleanly express what you 
       want to do on a page, without having to jump through
       any hoops.
   </dd>
   </dl>

JSP does have the advantage of being more standard than our approach, mostly
owing to the fact that Sun is a very big company. On the other hand, WebMacro
will interoperate with Java Beans, and JSP is built around this idea as well.
Thus WebMacro scripts will interoperate with the raft of JSP beans that 
people will develop over the next while.
<p>
JSP is also likely better for one-off sites created by single developers: if
you just want to hack something out quickly and you don't care about 
cleanliness or clarity, then you can hack a lot together quickly by 
throwing it all in one page. But that will limit the future scalability
of your project, as the maintenance costs will mount as you try and 
maintain such a site in the long term.

<p>

<h3><font color="green">Server side XML: XSLT</font></h3>

XML and XSLT are excellent technologies. I see them as being orthogonal 
to a template language, and in some projects I like to use both. I think
they work well together.
<p>
WebMacro and XML are close in spirit: both share an overriding desire
to see the generation of a page separated into content-creation 
operations, and rendering operations. In both you are forced to 
separate the creation of your content from its display.
<p>
But, they are suited to very different problems. WebMacro is ideally
suited for rendering database driven data, data coming from a back
end object model, or data thrown together on the fly. With a WebMacro
template it is easy to throw together bits and pieces from all 
different back ends and say exactly where you want to put them
on the page. With an XML templating system this can be a horrendous
experience, resulting in Frankenstein documents concocted from a 
variety of sources, mixed with XSLT templates strained to their
limits by the radical rearrangement of the structure and order
of the text that is required.
<p>
XML is ideally suited for the task of transforming a free flowing, 
pure, cleanly specified document from one form to another. It's 
offers an easy, clean, and elegant way to express the transformation
from XML to HTML on a tag by tag basis. With a WebMacro template 
the same operation can be challenging. Recursively specifying a 
transformation on a deeply structured document is possible with
WebMacro, but it isn't any prettier than the Frankenstein XML/XSLT
described above.
<p>
WebMacro and XSLT are complimentary technologies. I would recommend
you combine them: lay out the overall framework of your site with
a WebMacro template, and drop into it chunks of crisp, clear XSLT
processing to handle discrete untis of content. 
<p>
It's easy to implement an #xsl directive in WebMacro that allows 
you to place XML into a WebMacro variable and have it rendered 
on the page, using XSLT, wherever you refer to it.
<p>
By combining two technologies which share a common vision (separation
of content creation from display) but with complementary strengths
you can create a very powerful page generation system.

<h3><font color="green">Server Side EcmaScript/JavaScript</font></h3>

Like the WebMacro langauge, server side EcmaScript/JavaScript implementations
work on the theory that you should have a template into which you stick 
simple programming language statements.
<p>
Unfortunately the EcmaScript/JavaScript idea of "simple" is fairly complex
if you are a graphics designer--it looks and feels like a full fledged 
programming langauge, because it is one. 
<p>
Also, most of the JavaScript statements cannot easily be embedded in HTML. 
There are too many conflicts between the JavaScript language and HTML, so
most of the JavaScript ends up in a separate block. 
<p>
The EcmaScript/JavaScript approach is likely to suit you if you want to 
be a programmer and a web designer at the same moment in time. If you are
like most people, though, you probably switch gears when you move from 
analytical programming to artistic creation.
<p>
And of course our approach is much better suited to you if you are really
a team of people, some of whom are web site designers and some of whom 
are programmers.
<p>
With WebMacro we are not adverse to server-side JavaScript at all: we 
want to support it in a future version. However, we also want to keep 
it out of the web designer's face.

<p>

<h3><font color="green">Non-Java Tools</font></h3>

There are a ton: PHP, LiveScript, Oracle's server development toolkit, 
the very important embedded PERL script, and so on. 
<p>
I am not aware of any tools that have taken an approach exactly like ours
in other languages--but there are numerous good tools out there that 
solve the same problem.
<p>
Some of these have tried to invent new programming langauges for you 
to use (eg: PHP). These are full fledged specialized languages, but 
they are not as widespread or standard as Java/PERL/etc., and are not
as powerful as those languages either. 
<p>
Our appoach is to let you use a more powerful conventional langauge when
that is appropraite; the rest of the time we provide the glue that fits 
that together with the web page.
<p>
Some other technologies are actually more standard languages that have 
been embedded into web pages. Embedded PERL in particular is pretty
enticing--however it too is a non-web-design language stuck in the
graphics designers face: PERL can be a pretty messy thing for a  
non-programmer to have to read.
<p>
Also, perhaps you have chosen to use the WebMacro package because you
want to use Java on the server side. If you are looking for reasons
why you would want to develop in Java:
<ul>
  <li>It's a clean, robust, object oriented language that can scale up 
      to large project scope
  <li>It's very fast for an interpreted language, multi-threaded, 
      reliable, and safe
  <li>It's secure; you can install a rigorous security policy to 
      protect your servers from hostile users or even hostile servlet 
      authors!
  <li>There's a ton of tools available: a whole raft of "enterprise" 
      APIs, libraries, and toolkits for you to take advantage of, 
      including tons of database support, XML support, and so on. 
  <li>It's massively cross-platform, especially for server side 
      applications where messy Java GUI issues are irrelevant
  <li>Internationalization support is real--you can support all 
      languages, and all the built in Java libraries know it--from
      Unicode character sets right down to interoperability with
      different calendar systems.
</ul>

Of course here are some reasons why you might not want to use Java:

<ul>
  <li>Your project is due next week and you haven't learned Java yet
  <li>You have a huge code base already written in PERL and you aren't
      about to abandon it 
  <li>You are performing a specialized task and there is a language 
      that is ideally suited to that purpose.
  <li>Your boss told you to use Visual Basic, and though you really
      really hate it, you don't have a choice
</ul>

Well don't despair--WebMacro will not solve your problem <i>yet</i>,
but we are planning to. Future versions will include support for an
arbitrarily large number of langauges.
<p>
The core engine will still be based in a Java program--but we won't
let that stop us from interoperating with Perl, Python, Visual
Basic, JavaScript, and just about anything we can figure a way to
support.
<p>
We know that other languages are frequently better suited to a 
particular application, and we plan to support that. 
<p>
Right now, though, if you want to write Java code on the server side, 
and you don't want your web designer to see it--that's the main problem
we're here to solve.

<h3><font color="green">Drag'n'Drop Ra[bp]id development tools</font></h3>

Lots of vendors offer drag and drop tools for web page designers. The 
idea here is that by using a visual interface somehow the underlying 
complexity goes away. I have even seen langauges that take the extreme 
of trying to come up with visual metaphors for iteration and conditional
expressions.
<p>
In general I don't buy it. It's a hopeful idea, and if someone actually
makes it work effectively it'd be great.
<p>
But I am convinced that it is easier for a non-programmer to learn a very
small number of programming concepts (very small!) than to try and force
the current art of programming into a visual metaphor--and subject web page
designers to that like guinea pigs.
<p>
Our approach is to try and simplify programming constructs down, rather
than pretend they are not there. We have simple loops, simple conditionals,
and simple variable substitution.
<p>
We abandon concepts like "loop condition" in favour of the concept of 
walking through all the elements of a list. We hope that it is not too much
of a stretch for graphics designers to understand what a condition is, so long
as we don't resort to complicated boolean expressions.
<p>
The price you pay here is of course that your language is not powerful 
enough to satisfy a more advanced programmer. Our answer here has been to 
resort to a standard programming language like Java, in its own block, that
provides all the tools and power an advanced programmer would want.
<p>
We don't want to try and reinvent programming as a visual art any more 
than we want to try and re-invent Java, PERL, or anything else.
<p>
