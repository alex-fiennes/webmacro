A Java serlet is a web-based Java program. You can think of a Java
servlet as being similar to a CGI program, or a module plugged into
a webserver. 
<p>
The Java Servlet API is a standard interface which defines how 
servlets are created, and what information they have access to. 
An implementation of the Java Servlet API is called a servlet 
engine, or servlet runner.
<ul>
  <li>A "servlet engine" is a webserver, or part of a webserver,
      capable of running Java Servlets. Examples include 
      Resin, Orion, Tomcat, ServletExec, and JRun. 
      <p>
  <li>Servlet engines can work as standalone webservers, or can
      be integrated into a standard webserver like Apache, IIS,
      or Netscape.
</ul>
<p>
Here are the key features of the Java servlet API:
<ul>
   <li>Threaded. Each instance of a servlet handles multiple 
       requests simultaneously. Servlets do not "exit". When a
       request comes in the service() method of your servlet 
       will be invoked, and handed copies of the Request and
       Response APIs.
       <p>
   <li>Servlet Request API: HttpServletRequest contains incoming
       form variables, information about the browser, submitted
       cookies, everythign else known about the incoming request.
       <p>
   <li>Servlet Response API: HttpServletResposne contains all of
       the information that is to be returned to the user: what
       data stream to write to, an API for setting cookies, a 
       means of setting response headers, etc.
       <p>
</ul>

Writing a Java servlet means implementing the service() method and
handling the request. You do that by examining the HttpServletRequest
and filling in the HttpServlet response. 
<p>
Here is what the servlet API does <i>not</i> do for you:
<ul>
  <li><b>Data management.</b> You need to use JavaBeans, Java DataBase 
      Connectivity API (JDBC), or some other API to manage your 
      back-end data.
      <p>
  <li><b>Page generation.</b> The servlet API gives you a stream to write
      to. How you generate the data you write to that stream is 
      up to you. WebMacro is an example of a page generation tool.
      <p>
  <li><b>Advanced control.</b> The servlet API does a lot of tracking and
      reporting already, but a sophisticated site will want to 
      extend the form handling, session management, and other 
      services provided by the API.
</ul>

Typically you would provide a back-end set of general Java objects
as your model, likely interfacing with a database such as JDBC. You 
will write a controlling servlet which instantiates and uses WebMacro
templates to return a view. You will supply a set of templates along
with that view, as well as potentially a set of WebMacro ContextTools
to allow for page-driven development.
