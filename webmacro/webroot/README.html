<a name="About"><h2>About WebMacro</h2></a>

WebMacro is a free Java development package that allows you to keep
HTML and presentational issues out of your Java servlet code--while
providing web designers with a simple template language capable of
displaying any Java object.  <p>

WebMacro was mostly written by Justin Wells, with a lot of help from 
Yuen-Ping Leung, and crucial support from the WebMacro mailing list.  <p>

WebMacro is available for use under the GPL (v2), or you may negotiate
a less restrictive license with Semiotek Inc. See the attached 
<a href="docs/License.html">LICENSE</a> file for specific details.

<a name="Anatomy"><h2>Anatomy of this Release</h2></a>

<ul>
<li> webmacro.jar contains all the core classes, and needs to be added
     to your classpath.
     <p>
<li> src.zip contains all the .java source code for WebMacro, you only
     need it if you intend to modify the source
     <p>
<li> docs contains all the documentation, including the JavaDoc 
     stuff under webroot/api, and licensing information.
     <p>
<li> examples contains a few example WebMacro programs and templates 
     for you to look at to figure out how things work
     <p>
</ul>

<p>

<a name="Install"><h2>How To Use It</h2></a>

<ul>

  <li>This step applies to the HelloWorld and GuestBook examples,
      which use the WMServlet base class approach:
      <p>
      These classes are servlets. Compile them and install them in 
      your servlet directory. Note that there are multiple .class
      files for GuestBook.
      <p>
      Then follow the instructions below to configure your classpath,
      and edit the webmacro.properties configuration file.
      <p>

  <li>This step applies to the TestWM example, which uses the Handler 
      approach:
     <p>
     This class implements the Handler interface, and is not a
     servlet itself. It relies on the WebMacro Reactor servlet
     to load and run it. This approach is advantageous if you 
     want to subclass from something else instead of WMServlet.
     <p>
     For example, to use the TestWM handler from webmacro/examples
     with the JSDK's servletrunner, you would add the following
     line to servlet.properties:<pre>

        servlet.TestWM.code=org.webmacro.servlet.Reactor

     </pre>
     This names "TestWM" as the application (and therefore handler) 
     to use, and the WebMacro package as the server to use with it. WebMacro
     (Reactor) will then look for a handler named TestWM, so in this case
     you had better have webmacro/examples in your CLASSPATH so that it 
     finds the $HOME/webmacro/examples/TestWM.class handler (if you 
     unpacked webmacro in your home directory.)
     <p>

  <li> Edit the WebMacro.properties file to fix directories for your system
     You MUST set the directory in which templates live. To use the example
     code this would be in (perhaps) $HOME/webmacro/examples directory, which
     must be in your classpath.
     <p>
     <b>WARNING:</b> Be careful with what is meant by "classpath" here.
     WebMacro will try to load the properties file using the 
     ClassLoader (and therefore the classpath) which loaded 
     the classes in WebMacro.jar--some servlet runners, JRun 
     for example, set this classpath in a configuration file.
     <p>

  <li> You need to have the JSDK installed and working, or an 
     equivalent servlet interface, and it has to be in your CLASSPATH.
     <p>

  <li> You need a Java 1.1 compatible runtime environment to use
      the WebMacro.jar file distributed with this release. Java2
      users should unpack the sources, erase the contents of 
      org/webmacro/util/java2 (pseudo classes which conflict 
      with the real Java2 counterparts), and recompile. See the
      section on compiling for help.
     <p>

  <li> You need to include WebMacro.jar in your classpath
     <p>

  <li> You need to include your own Java directory in your classpath, where
     you will have your WebMacro handlers and other work. To use the 
     WebMacro examples you might use $HOME/webmacro/examples--it is usually
     convenient to make this the same directory as your WebMacro.properties
     files lives in.
     <p>

</ul>

  Here is an example CLASSPATH: <pre>

CLASSPATH=$JAVA_HOME/lib/classes.zip:$HOME/webmacro/webmacro.jar:$HOME/WebMacro/examples:$JSDK_HOME

  </pre>

  You have unpacked WebMacro in your home directory in this example. 
  $JSDK_HOME contains the "javax" directory in which you have your JSDK
  base classes, and JAVA_HOME/lib/classes.zip contains the standard library.   

  <h3>Using the examples</h3>

  Follow the steps above. Then read the comments at the head of
  each examples .java file for detailed instructions.
  <p>
  Note that the examples are not pre-compiled, you must compile
  them. 
  <p>
  HelloWorld and GuestBook use the WMServlet approach, so put all their 
  .class files in your servlet directory.
  <p>
  TestWM uses the Reactor method. So register Reactor as the
  servlet with TestWM as its script name (last part of the
  URL).


<a name="Compiling"><h2>How to Compile WebMacro</h2></a>

WebMacro ships with a webmacro.jar file compiled for JDK 1.1.7
and 1.1.8; to use WebMacro with java2 you will need to recompile.

<ul>
  <li> You need the JSDK sources installed and in your classpath. 
  <li> You need a FULLY compliant Java compiler for JDK 1.1.7 or better.
       Please note that Sun's "javac" and compiler derived form it do 
       not fulfil this requirement, as JDK 1.1 javac has a known bug 
       with respect to blank final variables. Hopefully this will be 
       fixed in Java2/JD1.2--in the meantime you can use IBM's jikes 
       compiler, which IS fully compliant with the Java specification.
    
  <li> Unpack the src.zip file in a directory that is part of your classpath
</ul>

<p>
To compile under JDK 1.1.7 and 1.1.8:
<ul>
  <li> you must use "jikes" (compiler from IBM, free)
     rather than javac, due to a compiler bug in
     javac relating to final variables.

  <li> WebMacro comes with some java2 imitation classes
     in org.webmacro.util.java2, which you can compile
     against. Alternately, if you have the JDK 1.1 
     version of the collections API installed, you
     can erase the java2 directory and compile 
     against that. Some changes to import statements
     may be required.
</ul>
To compile under java2:
<ul>

  <li> you need the most recent version of javac, or
     the most recent version of jikes. Older 
     versions may result in "Invalid stack length" errors
     arising at runtime due to compiler bugs.

  <li> erase the files in org/webmacro/util/java2, to
     avoid conflicts with the java2 collections API.
     Thus causes WebMacro to use the actual collections
     API rather than the imitation classes.
</ul>
Note that you cannot compile against the imitation classes and
expect WebMacro to properly introspect classes derived from the
real collections API. Thus, when you use the real collections API
you must use it for everything, not using WebMacros imitation
classes for anything.
<p>
See the website for a link to jikes; and check the FAQ and 
mailing list if you have any trouble.
<p>
A few more notes:
<ul> 
  <li> Many classes have test harnesses on them, written as main(),
       which you can use to test whether things are working for you.

  <li> There is a 'mkdoc' shell script available to create the JavaDoc 
       documentation in under the webroot directory. This just contains
       the correct javadoc command, so if you are running under NT you 
       can inspect it to see the correct command line to generate 
       the javadocs. 

</ul>


<a name="Overview"><h2>Overview of the WebMacro System: </h2></a>

   WebMacro is similar in many ways to JSP/ASP and other projects in many
   ways, but differs from those according to our biases:
   <ul>

      <li> We think it is wrong to use markup for a scripting language
      <li> We think it is wrong to embed programs on a web page
      <li> We think it is wrong for web scripts to look like hard programming

      <li><b> We believe that programming and graphics design 
              are separate tasks</b>
   </ul>

   So we have designed a language very much like all the other, but which 
   fits with our biases above.  <p>

   WebMacro presents two separate interfaces:  <ol>

       <li> A template language for web page designers to use, into which
          they can substitute values from a web program 

       <li> A library and framework for web based programming, for use 
          by technical developers, which is independent of any layout 
          or other graphical concerns

   </ol>
   You might be both a graphics designer AND a programmer. Many people are. 
   However I think you will agree that these activies use different sides
   of your brain--or at least very different kinds of thinking--and it is 
   painful to try and do both at the same time.    <p>

   Alternately you might be a programmer working with a web designer: By 
   providing the web designer with a list of variables which they can 
   substitute into a page, you keep the designer at some distance from 
   your sensitive program codes. At the same time, the designer is free 
   to take those variables and lay them out any which way they please.    <p>

   This separation of program code and content is the fundamental idea 
   behind the WebMacro system.    <p>



<h3>How It Works:</h3>

   You don't need to understand this section to use it, but it probably
   helps to read it anyway.
   <p>
   Note that many steps apply only to the Reactor method, as noted. The
   WMServlet method is much simpler.<ul>

   <li> You implement the org.webmacro.servlet.Handler interface, and write
      your application. This is the "top level class" of your application,
      and is akin to subclassing from applet. Alternately you can subclass
      from WMServlet and override its handle() method.

   <li> You set up a servlet with the same name as your application, but set 
      the code to be org.webmacro.servlet.Reactor instead of your class. 
      If you are using the JSDK servletrunner, you would do this in the 
      servlet.properties configuraiton file. You don't have to do this if 
      you subclassed from WMServlet--just register your servlet.

   <li> When a connection occurs, the Reactor checks the ScriptName, finds
      the matching Handler--it searches the classpath for a .class
      file with the same name as the servlet name of the request.
      This applies only to the Reactor/Handler approach. With the 
      WMServlet method, your class is a regular servlet--register
      it with your servlet runner as with any other Servlet.

   <li>WebMacro builds up a data structure called a WebContext,
      containing a bunch of objects that know how to interpret and return
      various kinds of information about the request. 

   <li>Your Handler or WMServlet.handle() method is invoked, and
   gets passed the WebContext object. You access cookies, form
   data, http headers, etc., through the WebContext object. You
   also populate the WebContext with your own data. Finally you
   decide which Template should be used to interpret your data,
   and you return that Template back to WebMacro.

   <li>WebMacro feeds your modified WebContext to the Template you have
      selected, and invokes the WebMacro interpreter

   <li> The processing engine interprets the Template according to the 
      data you have put into the WebContext. It uses Java's introspection
      and reflection library to extract values out of your data structures.
      It will perform iterations, substutions, and inclusions based on 
      the directives in the Template.
      
   <li> The result of this processing is returned to the user.      
  
   </ul>

Some notes: 
<ul>

<li> Each connection runs in its own thread, and templates are shared across
     threads. WebContext objects are unique to each thread, so you can write
     to them in an unsynchronized manner safely. You must carefully guard
     your Handlers own data structures against thread issues, since the
     same instance of your Handler can simultaneously serve many requests.

<li> Template files and other resources are managed by the ResourceBroker. 
     You can get a lot of useful data out of the ResourceBroker
     object--including templates, config information, and other
     objects. You can even register your own providers--replacing
     the default ones, or adding entirely new services.

<li> Variable lookup in the templates depend heavily on introspection 
     in the Property class. We're working on getting more informative errors
     out of that class--in the meantime if you really don't understand why
     some data has not been located in your Template, you might find it 
     helpful to edit com/semiotek/util/Property.java and set "debug" 
     to TRUE. If you set the log level to Log.DEBUG you will get a huge
     amount of feedback about what is going on (way too much actually.)
</ul>


<a name="Credits"><h2>Credits</h2></a>

WebMacro grew out of various internal projects at Semiotek Inc., and
was largely written by me--Justin Wells. It's my third attempt at 
a template oriented web framework, incorporating the experiences I
had with the previous systems.
<p>
Yuen-Ping Leung, a close friend and sometimes co-worker of mine, 
contributed a great deal to the project in its early days--and 
continues to help out on a regular basis. 
<p?
Finally, there are many others whose helpful suggestions, insights, 
criticisms, bug reviews, bug reports, comments, and advice have
helped make WebMacro what it is--Unfortunately so many people have
contributed so much on the mailing list that I am losing track! So
please forgive me, I am bound to forget a few important people:
<p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Simon Arthur</b>
  <dd>Model-View-Controller!! Simon noticed that this is what WebMacro
      is really all about.
      <p>

  <dt><b>Frank Carver</b>
  <dd>Shot down a lot of my bad ideas, and provided excellent critiques 
      of proposed features. 
      <p>

  <dt><b>Dirk-Willem van Gulik</b>
  <dd>Credit Dirk with the list initializer syntax--great idea!
      <p>

  <dt><b>Tom Goring</b>
  <dd>Bug finding! Plus lots of useful commentary on the list.
      <p>

  <dt><b>Ari Halberstadt</b>
  <dd>Tons of bugfixes. Lots of useful critiques, several features. Ari
      has been contributing useful stuff since the minute he subscribed.
      Literally.
      <p>

  <dt><b>Yuen-Ping Leung</b>
  <dd>I owe a lot to YP. She wrote a good chunk of the code in the early
      days. Unfortunately she's too busy with her real job to contribute
      much these days, but she says she wants to come back soon, let's
      hope she does!
      <p>

  <dt><b>Tom May</b>
  <dd>Code reviews! Lots of them, and always excellent! I never knew how
      much I hated "Chaper 17" before. 
      <p>

  <dt><b>Claudio Mio</b>
  <dd>Lots of good ideas on the list. Keep it up!
      <p>

  <dt><b>Cristi Opris</b>
  <dd>Cristi took the other side of the debate with David over SSI in
      WebMacro. The result was the comprimise involving WMServlet and
      the #param directive--a huge increase in WebMacro's capabilities.

  <dt><b>David Poon</b>
  <dd>A huge amount of excellent comments on the list. I am saving your  
      mail about the benefits of MVC for future reference. Also a good
      overview of WebMacro installation issues for NT--now in the FAQ!
      <p>

  <dt><b>Klaasjan Tukker</b>
  <dd>Tons and tons of bug finding. All of them valuable--and for quite
      some time now! 
      <p>
</dl>

Lots of other people have reported a bug or two. I don't have time to 
go back and find everyone's name anymore, though I wish I could. WebMacro's
stability is largely due to the great participation of everyone on the list.
<p>
In general, I rely heavily on the list to keep me out of trouble, find my
bugs, and point me in the right direction. So far everyone is doing a 
great job of that!
<p>
I encourage everyone to subscribe to the list and gripe about whatever 
bothers them, help me find flaws, suggest features, and periodically
vote on what direction we should take: send your subscribe message to 
<a href="mailto:webmacro-request@webmacro.org">webmacro-request@webmacro.org</a>
<p>
Thanks for all your support!
