<a name="About"><h2>About WebMacro</h2></a>

WebMacro is a free Java development package that allows you to keep
HTML and presentational issues out of your Java servlet code--while
providing web designers with a simple template language capable of
displaying any Java object.  <p>

WebMacro was mostly written by Justin Wells, with a lot of help from 
Yuen-Ping Leung, and crucial support from the WebMacro mailing list.  <p>

WebMacro is available for use under the GPL (v2), or you may negotiate
a less restrictive license with Semiotek Inc. See the attached 
<a href="docs/License.html">LICENSE</a> file for specific details.

<a name="Anatomy"><h2>Anatomy of this Release</h2></a>

<ul>
<li> webmacro.jar contains all the core classes, and needs to be added
     to your classpath for Java 1.1 use. If you want to use WebMacro 
     under Java2 you should recompile it WITHOUT the collections 
     classes. This will require replacing "com.sun.java.util.collections"
     with "java.util.collections" in the source code (this is the 
     only change you should need to make).
     <p>
<li>collections.jar contains the Sun JDK 1.1 collection classes, which
     WebMacro uses. You will need these under Java 1.1
    <p>
<li> src.zip contains all the .java source code for WebMacro, you only
     need it if you intend to modify the source
     <p>
<li> docs contains all the documentation, including the JavaDoc 
     stuff under webroot/api, and licensing information.
     <p>
<li> examples contains a few example WebMacro programs and templates 
     for you to look at to figure out how things work
     <p>
</ul>

<p>

<a name="Install"><h2>How To Use It</h2></a>

<ul>

  <li>This applies to the HelloWorld, Standalone, and GuestBook examples.
      <p>
      These classes are servlets. Compile them and install them in 
      your servlet directory. Note that there are multiple .class
      files for GuestBook, so be sure to copy all of them.
      <p>
      Then follow the instructions below to configure your classpath,
      and edit the webmacro.properties configuration file.
      <p>

  <li> Edit the WebMacro.properties file to fix directories for your system
     You MUST set the directory in which templates live. To use the example
     code this would be in (perhaps) $HOME/webmacro/examples directory, which
     must be in your classpath.
     <p>
     <b>WARNING:</b> Be careful with what is meant by "classpath" here.
     WebMacro will try to load the properties file using the 
     ClassLoader (and therefore the classpath) which loaded 
     the classes in WebMacro.jar--some servlet runners, JRun 
     for example, set this classpath in a configuration file.
     <p>

  <li> You need to have the JSDK installed and working, or an 
     equivalent servlet interface, and it has to be in your CLASSPATH.
     <p>

  <li> You need a Java 1.1 compatible runtime environment to use
      the WebMacro.jar file distributed with this release. Java2
      users should unpack the sources, erase the contents of 
      org/webmacro/util/java2 (pseudo classes which conflict 
      with the real Java2 counterparts), and recompile. See the
      section on compiling for help.
     <p>

  <li> You need to include WebMacro.jar in your classpath
     <p>

  <li> You need to include your own Java directory in your classpath, where
     you will have your WebMacro handlers and other work. To use the 
     WebMacro examples you might use $HOME/webmacro/examples--it is usually
     convenient to make this the same directory as your WebMacro.properties
     files lives in.
     <p>

</ul>

  Here is an example CLASSPATH: <pre>

CLASSPATH=$JAVA_HOME/lib/classes.zip:$HOME/webmacro/webmacro.jar:$HOME/WebMacro/examples:$JSDK_HOME

  </pre>

  You have unpacked WebMacro in your home directory in this example. 
  $JSDK_HOME contains the "javax" directory in which you have your JSDK
  base classes, and JAVA_HOME/lib/classes.zip contains the standard library.   

  <h3>Using the examples</h3>

  Follow the steps above. Then read the comments at the head of
  each examples .java file for detailed instructions.
  <p>
  Note that the examples are not pre-compiled, you must compile
  them. 
  <p>
  HelloWorld and GuestBook use the WMServlet approach, so put all their 
  .class files in your servlet directory.
  <p>
  TestWM uses the Reactor method. So register Reactor as the
  servlet with TestWM as its script name (last part of the
  URL).


<a name="Compiling"><h2>How to Compile WebMacro</h2></a>

WebMacro ships with a webmacro.jar file compiled for JDK 1.1.7
and 1.1.8; to use WebMacro with java2 you will need to recompile.

<ul>
  <li> You need the JSDK sources installed and in your classpath. 
  <li> You need a FULLY compliant Java compiler for JDK 1.1.7 or better.
       Please note that Sun's "javac" and compiler derived form it do 
       not fulfil this requirement, as JDK 1.1 javac has a known bug 
       with respect to blank final variables. Hopefully this will be 
       fixed in Java2/JD1.2--in the meantime you can use IBM's jikes 
       compiler, which IS fully compliant with the Java specification.
    
  <li> Unpack the src.zip file in a directory that is part of your classpath
</ul>

<p>
To compile under JDK 1.1.8:
<ul>
  <li> you may have to use "jikes" (compiler from IBM, free)
     rather than javac, due to a compiler bug in
     javac relating to final variables.

  <li>WebMacro uses the Java2 collections classes. Under JDK 1.1.8 
      you need to install and import the com.sun.java.util.collections
      classes in collections.jar. If you are compiling under Java2 you
      need to remove the import of these classes in order to compile
      with the collection classes in java.util.*. Please note that 
      under Java2 if you do not compile against the java.util.* versions
      of the collection classes, then WebMacro will fail to introspect
      the Java2 collections classes properly.
</ul>
<p>
See the website for a link to jikes; and check the FAQ and 
mailing list if you have any trouble.
<p>
A few more notes:
<ul> 
  <li> Many classes have test harnesses on them, written as main(),
       which you can use to test whether things are working for you.
       See in particular org.webmacro.engine.StreamTemplate, as a good
       example of how to use WebMacro outside of a servlet.

  <li> There is a 'mkdoc' shell script available to create the JavaDoc 
       documentation in under the webroot directory. This just contains
       the correct javadoc command, so if you are running under NT you 
       can inspect it to see the correct command line to generate 
       the javadocs. 

</ul>


<a name="Overview"><h2>Overview of the WebMacro System: </h2></a>

   WebMacro is similar in many ways to JSP/ASP and other projects in many
   ways, but differs from those according to our biases:
   <ul>

      <li> We think it is wrong to use markup for a scripting language
      <li> We think it is wrong to embed programs on a web page
      <li> We think it is wrong for web scripts to look like hard programming

      <li><b> We believe that programming and graphics design 
              are separate tasks</b>
   </ul>

   So we have designed a language very much like all the other, but which 
   fits with our biases above.  <p>

   WebMacro presents two separate interfaces:  <ol>

       <li> A template language for web page designers to use, into which
          they can substitute values from a web program 

       <li> A library and framework for web based programming, for use 
          by technical developers, which is independent of any layout 
          or other graphical concerns

   </ol>
   You might be both a graphics designer AND a programmer. Many people are. 
   However I think you will agree that these activies use different sides
   of your brain--or at least very different kinds of thinking--and it is 
   painful to try and do both at the same time.    <p>

   Alternately you might be a programmer working with a web designer: By 
   providing the web designer with a list of variables which they can 
   substitute into a page, you keep the designer at some distance from 
   your sensitive program codes. At the same time, the designer is free 
   to take those variables and lay them out any which way they please.    <p>

   This separation of program code and content is the fundamental idea 
   behind the WebMacro system.    <p>


<a name="Overview"><h2>How it works: </h2></a>

WebMacro relies heavily on introspection to glue your template to your 
back-end. On your back end you stick ordinary Java objects into your 
Context. WebMacro will then introspect these objects and make them 
available as properties in the template. 
<p>
Introspection is fairly expensive so WebMacro avoids doing this at 
execution time. The first time a class is introspected WebMacro caches 
the knowledge it gains about the class for efficient use in the future. 
Templates are also compiled into a form suitable for rapid-execution 
on first use. (Note that you have to turn on the Template caching 
in your WebMacro.properties file to see this behavior.)
<p>
The overall design of WebMacro is that the state for each request is 
contained in this Context object: you need to instantiate a new Context
for every request (you can create a prototype Context and then clone it 
for efficiency--this is automatically done for you most of the time.)
<p>
Since the state for each request is entirely contained within the Context,
templates can be shared between multiple requests. Since templates have 
no state, they don't need to be synchronized. Since Contexts are accessed
by only one thread ("thread per request") they don't need to be 
synchronized either. Thus you get very good performance out of WebMacro 
since most of the code can avoid the overhead of synchronization locks. 
<p> 
Finally, WebMacro is a framework. Most of its behavior is loaded dynamically
based on the configuration file, WebMacro.properties--the effect of this 
is that you can radically alter the behavior of WebMacro by replacing 
the classes named in WebMacro.properties with your own. There are a large
number of "plug points" in the design to allow an advanced user to 
customize WebMacro extensively. 
<p> 
For an ordinary user, though, it's good enough to rely on the default 
configuration. All you have to do is create contexts and load templates 
using the provided WebMacro interfaces. See the examples provided in 
the examples directory for more information.

<a name="Credits"><h2>Credits</h2></a>

WebMacro grew out of various internal projects at Semiotek Inc., and
was largely written by me--Justin Wells. It's my third attempt at 
a template oriented web framework, incorporating the experiences I
had with the previous systems.
<p>
Yuen-Ping Leung, a close friend and sometimes co-worker of mine, 
contributed a great deal to the project in its early days--and 
continues to help out on a regular basis. 
<p>
A special thanks as well to Jason Hunter and the folks over at the 
Java Apache project, who have contributed a lot of good ideas and 
frequently code as well. 
<p>
Of course there are all the people on the WebMacro mailing lists 
who have helped out in supporting WebMacro. I used to list you 
all here, but now you are too numerous!! But WebMacro wouldn't 
be what it is today without all the help from the list.
<p>
I encourage everyone to subscribe to the list and gripe about whatever 
bothers them, help me find flaws, suggest features, and periodically
vote on what direction we should take: send your subscribe message to 
<a href="mailto:webmacro-request@webmacro.org">webmacro-request@webmacro.org</a>
<p>
Thanks for all your support!
