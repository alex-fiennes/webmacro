<h1><font color="green">WebMacro: Frequently Asked Questions</font></h1>

This document answers some questions which are commonly asked on the 
mailing list. Hopefully you'll find the answers you're looking for 
here, or elsewhere in the documentation.
<p>
If not, please join the mailing list and ask! That's how answers 
wind up being in this FAQ. The mailing list is also the best place 
to suggest new features, talk about interesting uses of WebMacro, 
and debug problems you're having.
<p>
You can join the mailing list <a href="http://lists.semiotek.com/mailman/listinfo/webmacro">here</a>.


<h3><font color="green">What is WebMacro?</font></h3>

WebMacro is a free Java servlet development framework, including
a template language and extensible component model. It uses beans
and introspection to make any Java object in your servlet accessible
in your template.
<p>
The big idea is that HTML and other layout information should not 
appear in your program code; and program code should not appear 
in your HTML: 
<p>
WebMacro allows programmers to implement functionality 
with traditional objects and data structures, paying little or no 
attention to formatting issues.
<p>
Page designers then use WebMacro's template language to build standard
looking HTML pages, with format-oriented script codes (variables, loops,
conditionals) that have full access to the data structures created by 
the programmer.
<p>

<h3><font color="green">Where do I find help?</font></h3>

Use the mailing list for bug reports, feature suggestions, comments, 
criticisms, or any other feedback. Other users may be able to help you, 
and the developers are on the list if not. 
<p>
To join the list just <a href="http://lists.semiotek.com/mailman/listinfo/webmacro">visit our listserv</a> and add yourself.
<p>
Commercial users may also purchase support, along with a commercial license,
if support beyond that provided by the mailing list is inadequate. However,
the mailing list is pretty good.


<h3><font color="green">Why should I join the mailing list?</font></h3>

If you're using WebMacro we really want to hear from you--you'll become our
best resource: we want to know what works well, and we especially want to
know what doesn't work. You must have some ideas about how it could be 
improved, and you've probably noticed a few bugs.
<p>
If you don't report them, we can't fix them! And if you have a good idea 
that you don't tell us about--how are we supposed to implement it?
<p>
We also use the mailing list to post announcements, and hold votes on 
features or the direction WebMacro should go.

<h3><font color="green">How much does it cost?</font></h3>

WebMacro is free under the GNU Public License and the Semiotek Public
License (SPL). 
<p>

<h3><font color="green">Why is it free?</font></h3>

We've used free software extensively in our business, and we thought it
was high time we gave something back. Releasing WebMacro to the world 
makes me feel good about myself.
<p>
In addition, it makes good business sense. Semiotek is a small company
without a large marketing department. We live off contract work, and 
needed a way to get some more exposure. Releasing WebMacro
does that for us--we're hoping people will like it so much, they come and 
hire us to use it.
<p>
Finally, it'll improve the product we use for our regular work.
We've got a growing mailing list full of people using WebMacro for
their own work--regularly sending in feature suggestions, code
reviews, and bug reports.
<p>
So in my opinion, the open-source route is a big win all around: I get 
to feel good about life, Semiotek gets some badly needed PR, WebMacro
gains market share and beta testers, and you get WebMacro for free! 
<p>

<h3><font color="green">Who wrote it?</font></h3>

WebMacro was designed and implemented primarily by Justin Wells at
Semiotek Inc.; initially with a lot of help from Yuen-Ping Leung. The
people on the mailing list also deserve a lot of credit as well: many
of the design ideas, and a large number of bug fixes, are due to 
helpful list members! WebMacro's README gives them better credit.
<p>
Semiotek Inc. is a consulting company in Toronto, Ontario. We work 
primiarliy with large OO web projects, especially in Java. If you 
have some web design or programming you need done, perhaps using
WebMacro, you might contact us: 
<a href="mailto:info@semiotek.com">info@semiotek.com</a>


<h3><font color="green">How do I contact you?</font></h3>

Use the mailing list for support, feature requests, bug reports, general 
queries about WebMacro, and so forth--we read it!  However for
other issues, such as support and consulting services, information
about Semiotek Inc., etc., you should contact us via the general address: 
<a href="mailto:info@webmacro.org">info@webmacro.org</a>

<h3><font color="green">I can't get the WebMacro examples to work</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>Be sure that you have compiled them. They are not in the WebMacro.jar
    file and are shipped as source code. Once compiled, they must be in 
    your classpath.<p>

<li>Be sure that the webmacro.properties file is in your classpath, and
    that you have edited it to contain the correct values. It is sometimes
    confusing to know what CLASSPATH to use--put the properties file in
    the same place you put webmacro.jar<p>

<li>Check your classpath carefully. Most problems with WebMacro are 
    either incorrect paths in the webmacro.properties file, or else 
    incorrect classpaths.<p>

<li>Under NT: The \ character does not behave as expected in a Java
   properties file.  Instead of being a file separator, it is the
   escape character. You either have to use the Unix style / character,
   or escape the \ (by doubling it) to name a path in webmacro.properties.
   Thus the path C:\webmacro\examples should be written either as
   C:/webmacro/examples or as C:\\webmacro\\examples<p>

<li>Make sure you have JDK 1.1.6 or later. In particular, bugs in 
    JDK 1.1.3 prevent WebMacro from functioning correctly on NT and
    some other platforms.

<li>The GuestBook example should work as a traditional servlet. The
    configuration for TestWM is trickier and requires you to register
    Reactor as the servlet for the TestWM URL.

</ul>

<h3><font color="green">I have trouble compiling the WebMacro sources</font></h3>

First, you need to have at least JDK 1.1.6 to compile WebMacro. 
<p>
Second, you cannot use javac under JDK 1.1.6 and 1.1.7 since it has 
some bugs (with respect to final and static variables). Instead, use 
the jikes compiler which is freely available from IBM. 
<a href="Links.html">Check here</a> for a link to jikes.
<p>
Third, to compile WebMacro under Java2 you will have to edit the 
sources to fix minor incompatibilities. I have mirrored some of
the Java2 classes to make a future migration easier--in particular,
the classes in com/semiotek/util/java2 must be deleted to avoid 
conflicts with the built in collection API.

<h3><font color="green">Why don't updates to my templates show up in the running version?</font></h3>

Edit your WebMacro.properties file and set the cache expire time for
templates to zero. This will seriously degrade performance, but prove
invaluable during development. Set it back to 10min or so for 
production use. Note the expire clock is reset each time that
the template is accessed. 
<p>
There is no way to do this prior to version 0.85.


<h3><font color="green">What about syntax highlighting editors?</font></h3>

If you use EMACS, <a href="http://www.webmacro.org/contrib/webmacro.elisp">try this</a>, it
will highlight WebMacro directives in templates.
<p>

<h3><font color="green">Can I use JavaScript in a WebMacro template?</font></h3>

Yes. However, to avoid conflicts with WebMacro's braces you must put 
your JavaScript in a #use block, like this:
<br>
<pre>
  #use 'text' until end
    Javascipt here will not be parsed, { and } are safe
  end
</pre>
<br>
WebMacro will not attempt to parse anything between the start of 
the #use directive and the matching 'end' statement. 
<p>
You only need to do this for blocks of JavaScript which include 
{, }, #, or $ characters which are meaningful to WebMacro.

<h3><font color="green">Under WebMacro 0.75.3 and earlier I get errors in the log 
    indicating a problem with UserDB</font></h3>

Ignore them. UserDB is a prototype class that is broken under 0.75.3, and
not actually used by any of the example code. To turn these errors off, 
edit your WebMacro properties file and remove the line which loads the
UserProvider. It isn't needed.
