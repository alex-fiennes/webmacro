<h1><font color="green">WebMacro Licensing</font></h1>

This document outlines the licensing options available for WebMacro:
both for free use under the GNU General Public License; and for
commercial use outside the GPL.  Feel free to contact us if you
would like to work out a different arrangement than the standard
license options outlined here.  
<p>
You can <a href="Download.html">download WebMacro here</a>--including 
all source code, documentatiom, and this license information. 
<h3><font color="green">Your Choices</font></h3>

<font color="red"><b>IMPORTANT NOTICE</b></font>

WebMacro will likely come out under a less restrictive license in the 
very new future. The proposed license is similar to the LGPL. It is 
currently being reviewed by the OSS and free software community, and
will require subsequent legal review after that. 
<p>
Therefore, many people who wouldhave need a commercial license under
the existing license (the GPL) will not need a license under the new one.
<p>
The new license will be compatible with the GNU GPL, meaning that you 
can always opt to use WebMacro under the GNU GPL rather than whatever
license we propose.

<h4>WebMacro Free Software License</h4>
<blockquote>
WebMacro is free software: you may use it under the terms of the
<a href="COPYING" target="gpl">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL), 
version 2, as published by the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="fsf">Free
Software Foundation</a>.  
<p>
This is suitable if you are developing something for your own use, 
and do not intend to distribute it to others; or are willing to
make your software available for free under the terms of the GPL. 
<p>
Use WebMacro free under the GPL:
<ul>
   <li>Pay nothing
   <li>Build commercial or corporate sites
   <li>Benefit from open-source/free software development
</ul>

Read the <a href="COPYING" target="gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a> 
for details.
<p>
The GPL does not require you to distribute your
software--it only states that if you do, you must do so under 
the GPL. Also, you may charge a fee for developing something
under the GPL; you may charge a fee for distributing it; or you
may choose not to distribute it--keeping your program and 
sources private for use within your organization or website.
<p>
Most people will find they can use WebMacro for free under
these terms.

<h4>WebMacro Proprietary Developer License</h4>

To negotiate a proprietary use license, e-mail your inquiry to 
<a href="info@webmacro.org">info@webmacro.org</a>. Let us know 
why you cannot use the free software license, and what kind of 
license you think would be more appropriate for your case. We 
will negotiate a suitable proprietary license for your situation.
<p>
You can also negotiate a support contract with us. As with a license, 
simply send email to <a href="info@webmacro.org">info@webmacro.org</a>
to inquire. 
<p>
<h3><font color="green">A Reminder: WebMacro is Free Software</font></h3>

Remember, most people will be able to use WebMacro under the GPL for free!
You only need to acquire a commercial license if, for some reason, you are
unable to work with free software. 
<p>
Also, you can get pretty good support for WebMacro from the 
<a href="http://lists.semiotek.com/mailman/listinfo/webmacro">mailing list</a>.
