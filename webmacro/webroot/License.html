<h3><font color="green">Your Choices</font></h3>

People are putting WebMacro to many different uses. Below are some 
licensing arrangements tailored to some of the more common 
situations.
You could select one of these licensing arrangements as is, or view it 
as an example of the kinds of license we're willing to negotiate with you.
<p>

<h4>WebMacro Free Software License</h4>
<blockquote>
WebMacro is free software: you may use it under the terms of the
<a href="COPYING" target="gpl">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL), 
version 2, as published by the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="fsf">Free
Software Foundation</a>.  
<p>
This is suitable if you are developing something for your own use, 
and do not intend to distribute it to others; or are willing to
make your software available for free under the terms of the GPL. 
<p>
Use WebMacro free under the GPL:
<ul>
   <li>Pay nothing
   <li>Build commercial or corporate sites
   <li>Benefit from open-source/free software development
</ul>

Read the <a href="COPYING" target="gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a> 
for details.
<p>
The GPL does not require you to distribute your
software--it only states that if you do, you must do so under 
the GPL. Also, you may charge a fee for developing something
under the GPL; you may charge a fee for distributing it; or you
may choose not to distribute it--keeping your program and 
sources private for use within your organization or website.
<p>
Most people will find they can use WebMacro for free under
these terms.
</blockquote>


<h4>WebMacro Proprietary Developer License</h4>
<blockquote>

You are interested in using WebMacro to build proprietary products
or custom applications; you intend to distribute your application
to others for a fee, without giving them the rights that they
would get under the GPL (such as source, and the right to distribute
it to others).
<p>
The users of your applications are not themselves developers,
though they may want to customize look and feel of your application,
such as by editing and creating new templates.
<p>
This per-developer license may be best for you:
<ul>
  <li>Pay one flat fee for each programming developer using WebMacro
  <li>Build as many applications as you like
  <li>Template editors and page designers not considered developers; 
      so your clients can freely create and edit templates.
</ul>

Read the <a href="DEVELOPER.license">WebMacro Proprietary Developer 
License</a> for details, then contact us at 
<a href="mailto:info@webmacro.org">info@webmacro.org</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>

<h4>WebMacro Proprietary Server License</h4>
<blockquote>

You would like to use WebMacro as a standard development tool,
available for general use on your servers. You do not want to do
this under the GPL--perhaps because some of the servers or
some of the developers are outside your organization.
<p>
Under this license you license your servers, and can run as 
many WebMacro applications as you like, with as many developers
as you want. 

<ul>
  <li>Pay one flat fee to serve your entire organization
  <li>Have as many developers as you like
  <li>Build as many applications as you want
</ul>

Read the <a href="SERVER.license">WebMacro Proprietary Server
License</a> for details, then contact us at
<a href="mailto:info@webmacro.org">info@webmacro.org</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>

<h4>WebMacro Corporate and Product Licenses</h4>

<blockquote>
If you would like to license WebMacro for use across 
your entire organization, or if you would like a license 
based on a royalty, please email <a href="info@webmacro.org">
info@webmacro.org</a>.
<p>
We do offer such licenses, however they must be negotiated 
on an individual basis.
</blockquote>

<h3><font color="green">Acquiring a License</font></h3>

To negotiate a proprietary use license, e-mail your inquiry to 
<a href="info@webmacro.org">info@webmacro.org</a>. Let us know 
which of the license models you think is most suitable, or propose 
something more appropriate. 
<p>
We are also willing to offer volume discounts, if you want to purchase 
a large license.
<p>
Finally, we do not expect you to pay any licensing fees for beta 
versions of WebMacro. You may decide to negotiate your license prior 
to a non-beta release just to settle the issue--but your payment will not
be due until WebMacro has earned a stable designation!
<p>
Contact us to learn the current rates for each license.
<p>
You can also negotiate a support contract with us. As with a license, 
simply send email to <a href="info@webmacro.org">info@webmacro.org</a>
to inquire. 
<p>
<h3><font color="green">A Reminder: WebMacro is Free Software</font></h3>

Remember, most people will be able to use WebMacro under the GPL for free!
You only need to acquire a commercial license if, for some reason, you are
unable to work with free software. 
<p>
Also, you can get pretty good support for WebMacro from the 
<a href="http://lists.semiotek.com/mailman/listinfo/webmacro">mailing list</a>.
