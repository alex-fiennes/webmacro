<h1><font color="green">How to write Java servlets and create HTML templates with WebMacro</font></h1>

WebMacro provides a very simple interface for both program author and
web page designer--so you should be able to get simple things up and
working quickly.

If you have any questions or comments about WebMacro, we urge you 
to join the WebMacro <a
href="http://lists.semiotek.com/mailman/listinfo/webmacro">mailing
list</a>. It's there for technical support, feedback, bug reporting,
and so forth.
<p>
WebMacro configuration is fairly straight-forward: you have to
install WebMacro as a servlet, then edit its configuration file.
In future versions configuration will be web-based, but until then
please bear with us, you'll have to edit a couple of text files.
<p>
The best way to get going quickly is to look at the examples. WebMacro is
both an application framework, and a script language--so be sure and look
at both sides of it.
<p>
The <a href="api/index.html">API documentation</a> contains some pretty
comprehensive documentation which you should read as well.
<p>
This document will give you a very brief overview of the package.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="green">How To Install</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>You need to have a Java 1.2 VM in order to use this software; and if 
    you want to compile it you'll also need JDK 1.2 as well.
    <p>
<li>Follow the installation instructions in the <a href="README.html">README.html</a>
    text file included with the distribution. The short story is:
    You have to get a bunch of stuff into your CLASSPATH:
    <p>
    <ul>
       <li>The JSDK base classes have to be in your classpath
       <li>WebMacro.jar has to be in your classpath
       <li>The directory where you've put your handlers and other
           programs (or our example handlers) have to be in your classpth
       <li>Of course the core Java classes have to be there too
    </ul>
    <p>
    In addition to that, you have to edit the WebMacro.properties file
    to reflect the settings on your system. Make sure this WebMacro.properties
    is in a directory from the same classpath as WebMacro.jar: WebMacro
    will use the ClassLoader (and therefore the classpath) which loaded 
    it to try and find its properties file.
    <p>
    Finally, you have to configure your servlet runner to launch WebMacro
    under the names of the applications you want to use. See Below.
          
</ul>

<h3><font color="green">How to Configure</font></h3>
<ul>
<li>If your servlet is a subclass of WMServlet (such as the Guestbook
    example), simply place it in your servlets directory or register
    it in the standard way. You must also ensure that WebMacro.jar
    and Webmacro.properties are in your classpath (and that you
    have edited WebMacro.properties to contain the correct values
    for your system.).
    <p>
    Note that this makes your derived class a Servlet, therefore
    you must put it in your CLASSPATH or register it with your
    servlet runner as you would with any other servlet.
    <p>
    You can also use WebMacro in "standalone" mode, which means you 
    do not have to subclass from WMServlet. In this case, you instantiate
    and maintain your own copy of the WebMacro master class. WebMacro
    is provided with an example called "Standalone.java" demonstrating
    how to use this technique. 
    <p> 
    In either case, you must install your servlet in your servlets 
    directory and configure your servlet runner to serve it.
    <p>

<li>Edit the WebmMacro.properties configuration file. It specifies
    some things like the directory where templates are stored--if you
    do not se this, WebMacro won't be able to return anything at all 
    since it needs to find its templates to write data.
    <p>
    The most important thing you must specify in WebMacro.properties 
    is the TemplatePath. The default value probably won't work for 
    your system. 
    <p>
    For production use, and for performance testing, you also probably
    want to turn on template caching. Leave it turned off during 
    development so that you can conveniently edit your templates.
</ul>

<h3><font color="green">Writing Your Application</font></h3>
<ul>

<li>Write the core of your application in Java. This means subclassing 
    from org.webmacro.WMServlet, or else making use of the WebMacro 
    interface and managing things yourself in standalone mode. 
    <p>
    Subclass from WMServlet and implement the handle() method. You may 
    also wish to implement the start() and stop() methods to handle 
    initialization and shutdown of your servlet. 
    <p>
    Your handle method is passed an object called a WebContext. A new 
    Context is created for every request, and contains all of the state 
    required to handle the current request. Your WebContext contains 
    instances of HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse which you 
    can access as required. 
    <p> 
    Implement your processing code as if you were writing a standalone 
    Java application--with no HTML cluttering up your code. Place
    all output objects in the Context using Context.put().
    <p>
    Any object that you put into the WebContext is available as a 
    local variable to the template script. WebMacro uses introspection
    to analyze these objects and make their properties available as 
    variables in the template. 
    <p>
    Next you need to select a view to display to your user. Decide on a 
    template you wish to return, and load it using the getTemplate() 
    method. In WMServlet you simply return that template object; in the
    standalone approach you will need to call its template.write() method
    yourself to return output to the browser. 
    <p> 
    WebMacro takes care of everything else.
    <p>
<li><b>Property Introspection</b>: Templates use "Propety Introspection" to
     access the data you put into the WebContext. You should understand what
     that means.
     <p>WebMacro uses the introspection/reflection APIs to take a pretty deep
     look into the objects you stick in the WebContext. The template language 
     has access to the properties of the objects you throw into the
     map.
     <p>For simple values, it will attempt this in two ways:<p>
     <ul>
     <li>it will use the bean approach and look for public fields or
         appropriately named get/set methods.<p>
     <li>if it hasn't found a specific method, it will try and view
         the object as a collection and use put/get methods.<p>
     </ul>
<li> If you want to put in a list of objects into the template you have 
     numerous options. The property introspection method is capable
     of iterating through any of the following types:<p>
     <ul>
        <li>an array<p>
        <li>anything that has an elements() method that returns an Enumeration<p>
        <li>anything that has an iterator() method that returns an Iterator<p>
     </ul>
     NOTE: We do not <b>yet</b> support the indexed properties in the Java
     bean specification, but we will. Also the iterator() method above only
     mimics the JDK 1.2 iterators--we will convert to using real iterators 
     once the JDK 1.2 has been released.
     <p>
     The above introspection can be applied recursively, so all your objects
     have to do is provide a "customer[] getList()" method, for example, and 
     template users can loop through it conveniently.
     <p>
</ul>

<h3><font color="green">Creating Templates</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>Write a set of Templates to handle the output of your application. Each
    Template represents one page view in the system.
    <p>
    If the Handler write put an object called "customer" in the WebContext
    passed to your template, then you can access its fields like this:
    <p>
    <pre>Customer $customer.name owes $customer.owing</pre>
    <p>
<li>You can also loop through list values that may be part of an object:
    <p>
    <pre>
         &lt;ul&gt;
         #foreach $customer in $customerList
         {
            &lt;li&gt; $customer.name owes $customer.owing
         }
         &lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
<li> We also support really simple conditionals. In the current version all
    you can do is test whether something is defined or not:<pre>

    #if ($variable) {
       Yes we have variable: $variable
    } #else {
       Sorry, variable is not defined here
    }
    </pre><p>
<li>Other things you can do:
    <ul>
       <li>#include "someUnparsedFile.txt"
       <li>#set $variable = value
       <li>#parse "includeSomeWebMacroTemplate.wm"
       <li>#include "$variableFile"
       <li><pre>#use 'text' until "--The End--"
           Text here is not parsed by WebMacro, up until the line matching
           the supplied boundary. You can use this to surround sensitive 
           things like JavaScript, if you fear a conflict with WebMacro. In
           the long run we will use the #use directive to include support
           for inlining Java, Python, PERL, and other languages. For now
           the only supported parser is the "text" parser which passes 
           its contents through unmodified.
           --The End--</pre>
    </ul>
    Note that some of the above are currently untested.
    <p>
    The WebMacro context includes a bunch of convenient variables that you
    can access. See the Javadoc comments for the WebContext class for details:
    <ul>
       <li>$Broker allows you to read things from the ResourceBroker,
           an extensible resource manager which a programmer can plug
           components into on the back and.
       <li>$CGI provides access to CGI-style variables
       <li>$Form provides access to FORM data 
       <li>$Config provides access to properties in WebMacro.properties
       <li>$Cookie allows you to get and set cookies from the template
       <li>$Session allows you to get and set things in the JSDK session
       <li>$Request is the HTTP request (HttpServletRequest)
       <li>$Response is the HTTP response (HttpServletResponse)
    </ul>
</ul>
