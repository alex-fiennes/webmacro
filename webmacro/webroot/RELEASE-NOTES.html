Fixes serious bug in Settings.getIntegerSetting

<h2>Webmacro 0.95beta: RELEASE NOTES</H2>

This release is similar in functionality to the 6 Dec 2000 snapshot
release; it is a candidate for release as the 0.95 release, with many 
bug fixes.  

<h2>WebMacro 06-12-2000: RELEASE NOTES</h2>

This release fixes a couple of bugs: I'm rolling it up mainly to
make the character encoding fix available to more people.

<ul>
  <li><b>Character Encoding</b> <br>

To propertly internationalize characters in WebMacro you must:               
<ol>
<li>Set the correct encoding on FastWriter when you creaet it.               
WMServlet defaults to setting it to whatever the                       
HttpServletRequest object asks for so in WMServlet you                
may not need to do anything. If you run WM in standalone                 
mode you must specify the correct encoding when you                      
create a new FastWriter:<pre> 
   FastWriter fw = FastWriter.getInstance(out, "Big5");                
</pre>
For example.<p> 

<li> If there is internationalized text in your templates then              
you must also ensure that the templates are read in correctly            
by WebMacro. You do this by setting                                      <pre>
   TemplateEncoding: Big5                                  
</pre>
or whatever in your WebMacro.properties. If yoru templates               
can be read as UTF-8 (they're ASCII++) then you don't need           
to do anything.                                                          
<p>

<li><b>Profiling</b> <br>

The profiling code has been sped up significantly. Also you can
now use it to profile standalone code as well, writing output 
in an ascii format using the CallGraph.format() methods to 
produce ASCII output.
<p>

<li><b>General Cleaning</b> <br>

The exception hierarchy has been cleaned some more, particularly 
exceptions coming from the WM class and the Broker. You should now
get more relevant information about what went wrong and what 
you can do about it.
</ul>

<b>STATUS</b>: Need to fix a few things with Log and this should 
be getting close to being the fastest, most stable WM yet.
<p>
Thanks to you!
<p>

<h2>WebMacro 01-12-2000: RELEASE NOTES</h2>

This release adds several key improvements and a bunch of house 
cleaning has been done:
<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>WebMacro.defaults</b> <br>

   WebMacro configuration has now been broken into two parts: 
   WebMacro.defaults and WebMacro.properties. The WebMacro.defaults
   file is not intended to be manipulated by ordinary WebMacro 
   users and is included inside webmacro.jar. It provides sensible
   default values for the settings in WebMacro.properties. Setting
   a value in WebMacro.properties overrides the setting in 
   WebMacro.defaults. 
   <p>
   The consequence of this change is that if the default value works
   for you, you don't even have to mention that value in your 
   WebMacro.properties file. Pretty soon we should be able to 
   provide sensible defaults for all settigns eliminating the need
   for WebMacro.properties--in the current release you still 
   still need a WebMacro.properties file so you can set a 
   valid TemplatePath. 
   <p>

  <li><b>Profiling</b>, <b>#profile directive</b>, <b>Profile example</b><br>
    WebMacro now includes a profiling library which can help you 
    track down where the time is going in your application. It should
    also help us improve the performance of WebMacro over time. 
    <p>
    There are three key parts to the profiling architecture:
    <ul>
      <li>org.webmacro.profile: this package contains the profiling code
      <li>#profile directive can bracket segments on a template and
          provide timing statistics 
      <li>examples/Profile servlet demonstrates profiling and also 
          if you run it provides a live view of the profiling data
          collected by the profiling architecture.
    </ul>
    There are two new parameters in the configuration file:
    <pre>
         Profile.rate: 5
         Profile.time: 120000
    </pre>

    The Profile.rate determines what percentage of web requests
    are sampled for profiling. Set it to 0 to turn profiling off, 
    or 1 to sample every request. The above example sets it to 5,
    which samples 1/5th of the page requests. 
    <p>
    The Profile.time determines how long a profiled page is used
    in the statistics. The above example sets it to 2 minutse, which
    means that two minutes after a page is requested its profile 
    sample will be forgotten. At any given time the profile system
    is reporting the performance of the site over the last 
    Profile.time milliseconds. 
    <p>
    You can instrument your code by calling context.startTiming(...) 
    and you must subsequently call context.stopTiming(). If you don't
    call stopTiming exactly once for every call to startTiming then
    the profiling data will be gibberish.
    <p>
    You can instrument your templates by using the #profile directive.
    It looks like this:
    <pre>
          #profile "example name" {
             some template script
          }
    </pre>
    Webmacro will then collect statistics on how long it took to 
    execute that block of template script, reporting it under the
    name "example name" in the profiling statistics. 
    <p>
    There is a slight cost in having the profiling code installed
    in WebMacro. You can eliminate this cost, and completely 
    disable profiling, by setting org.webmacro.flags.PROFILE to
    "false" and recompiling all of the code.
    <p>
  
 <li><b>Exception hierarchy cleaned up</b> <br>

    Some exceptions have been eliminated, allowing exceptions flowing
    from PropertyOperator to propagate further up through the code, 
    among other things. Hopefully the quality of error reporting will
    be improved by this, but it's possible that in some cases it is
    now slightly worse than before--we need reports of what those 
    cases are so we can fix it up!
    <p>

 <li><b>Context housecleaning</b><br>
  
    I reworked the implementation of many of the methods in context
    to make it simpler. This is a precursor to a next round of 
    cleaning which will be performance driven. I touched a lot of
    difficult and critical code while doing this, and while I think
    it is correct now, we need to test everything out and prove 
    that it is all working as expected. My servlets work. No observable
    functionality change should result from this--I'm just mentioning
    it so you can be on the lookout for any problems.
    <p>
</ul>

We had expected to release 0.95 by now instead of another snapshot but
we have a few issues to work out with the Log API. Once those are 
worked out this code should become 0.95, sorry for the delay!
<p>


<h2>WebMacro 21-11-2000: RELEASE NOTES</h2>

Here are the key changes in this snapshot:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>FastWriter buffering:</b><br>
    FastWriter now buffers all output until an explicit flush(). The
    consequence of this is that you will not see any output from your
    template at all until you flush the page. The good news is this 
    fixes bugs on several peoples platforms whereby they could not 
    set the content type from the template. The bad news is that it 
    hurts time-to-first-byte and may reduce perceived performance. We
    will likely come back and address this with some flushing at 
    specific points to alleviate the time-to-first-byte problem. 
    <p>
    You can also extract the contents written to FastWriter with a
    couple of useful methods: writeTo(outstream), toString(), and
    toByteArray().
    <p>
<li><b>Character encoding issues:</b><br>
    As of this release the only place you need to set the character 
    encoding for <i>output</i> is on FastWriter. When you create the
    FastWriter select the character encoding you wish to send back to
    the users browser. There are still some issues with where the 
    character encoding for templates is read from--currently it 
    defaults to UTF8.
    <p>
<li><b>ContextTool.destroy(Object):</b><br>
    Context tools are used to initialize objects on a template on 
    demand. There is a need to be able to clean these objects up
    as well so a destroy() method has been added. When a Context
    is clear()'d your ContextTool's destroy method will be called
    and passed back whatever object your init() method returned. 
    This allows pooling, caching, and other cleaning up.
    <p>
<li><b>Bug Fixes & More</b>:<br>
    setBean() fixed up by keats, some synchronization issues addressed,
    and some tinkering with the URLTemplateProvider replacement for
    TemplateProvider. 
    <p>
<li><b>Licensing Loosened</b>:<br>
    The "advertising" clause of the Semiotek Public License has been
    loosened to be a "copyright" clause. Instead of putting an 
    acknowledgement on all advertising material now you only have
    to place the acknowledgement everywhere any copyright statement
    is made. 
</ul>
 


<h2>WebMacro 0.94: RELEASE NOTES</h2>

The release notes describe the changes for each version,
and what to do about it--<b>including important advice about
upgrading</b>: pre 1.0 there are often incompatible changes 
between versions. These notes will always mention it, 
and include advice on what to do.
<p>
<hr>

<ul>

<li>WebMacro now requiers you to pass a FastWriter object to its 
    Macro interface. You can easily create one from an OutputStream
    and it substantially improves WebMacro's performance.  <p>

<li>There are numerous performance enhancements in the current release.  <p>

<li>A bunch of bugs were fixed: the newline at the top of the file should
    be gone, and the problem with \$ at the end of a quoted string have
    been fixed. <p>

<li>WebMacro is provisionally available under the terms of the Semiotek
    Public License in addition to the GNU General Public License, version 2. 
    You may use it under whichever is preferable for your project. <p>

<li>Many components of WebMacro are added via the WebMacro.properties 
    file now. YOU SHOULD CHECK THIS FILE since any new features added
    to WebMacro now likely require a corresponding addition in your 
    .properties file. You should make sure you have everything! Things
    that used to be compiled into WebMacro are now loaded this way.  <p>

<li>There's a whole set of top level interfaces present now, which you
    will find in org.webmacro. You need to include only these to use 
    WebMacro, and org.webmacro.servlet.* as well if you are running
    under a servlet engine rather than stand-alone. These interfaces
    assist with stand-alone use of WebMacro.  <p>

<li>A key new interface is the Context: WebMacro used to pass around 
    an arbitrary object as the context. Now it has this interface with
    a lot of information contained it. There is still an abitrary 
    class in there, accessed via getBean() and setBean().  <p>

<li>There are things called ContextTools which you can register with
    a Context. Under WMServlet you just register them in your 
    WebMacro.properties file. These give you a way to create 
    useful tools that can be accessed from any context, without
    having to be specially added to the contexts individually. 
    Many existing services provided by WebContext have now been 
    re-implemented as tools. Thus you can de-register them if you 
    don't like them, or re-implment your own versions.  <p>

<li>WebMacro script blocks can be delimited with either {}'s as 
    in older versions, or with #begin and #end statements. It is 
    possible to disable the interpretation of {}'s and use ONLY
    the #begin and #end syntax via a setting in the WebMacro.properties
    file. This makes life easier if you have a lot of JavaScript 
    in your templates.  <p>

<li>Returning a "null" from the handle method in WMServlet now 
    means "do nothing", rather than result in a NullPointerException.
    This is actually a useful feature, since you can use it to 
    disable WebMacro's processing of the template--say you already
    processed it yourself.  <p>

<li>The semantics of the #use directive has changed: it no longer 
    takes an "until" paramter!!  <p>

<li>We now use the Sun collection tools under JDK 1.1, which means 
    you need the collections.jar containing them. We're allowed to 
    include that, so we did. Under Java2 you do NOT want to use 
    these classes, since the same collections are available in the 
    standard API. You need to remove the imports for the classes
    in com.sun.java.util.collections.* under Java2. Because this is
    extra work we will provide Java1 and Java2 versions of WebMacro
    for the next release.  <p>

<li>Whitespace rules have been significantly improved since the release.  <p>

<li>Advanced Use: Filtering: There is a mechanism for filtering a
    variable through a macro. This is a very powerful technique
    and can be used for everything from HTML escaping your output,
    to writing sub-templates which know how to intelligently display
    certain types of objects.  See the #filter directive.  <p>

<li>Advanced use: There are now directives called #local, #tool, 
    and #property to specify whether a variable is a property 
    introspection on the bean, a local variable, or a reference
    to a tool. THESE ARE NOT NEEDED in ordinary use, but they are
    very helpful when you start using filters.  <p>

<li>Advanced use: The whole parsing engine has been rewritten. You
    can now plug in your own parser: see the Parser interface. You
    could also subclass WMTemplate and override the getParser() method
    to use your parser rather than the default WebMacro parser. This
    changes the syntax of the templates, but it does *not* affect the
    availability of the WebMacro directives you are familiar with. The
    parser can create those using the DirectiveBuilder API, independent
    of the syntax in the template.  <p>

<li>A *lot* of bugs have been fixed since the last release. Too 
    numerous to list them all here.


</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Release 0.89.1</h3>
May 3rd, 1999
<p>
Fixed a bug in the new conditional code; a condition is false if
the return of a method o.equals(Boolean.FALSE) rather than ==.
<p>

<h3>Release 0.89</h3>
May 2nd, 1999
<p>

This release adds some key functionality, and fixes several
bugs:

<ul>
<li><b>Full conditional logic.</b> #if directive conditions can now
    make use of the boolean operators: <b>&&</b> (and),  <b>||</b> 
    (or), and the unary operator <b>!</b> (not). These boolean 
    ooerators mean the same thing they do in Java. They are 
    left-associative, and short circuiting (meaning the right 
    operand is evaluated only if it has to be).
    <p>
    You can also use the boolean ooerators <b>==</b> (equals) 
    and <b>!=</b> to compare objects. These do not behave like
    Java operators do: they rely on Object.equals() rather 
    than object identity to determine equivalence.
    <p>
    A conditional can use any WebMacro Term as its operands. A Term
    is considered false if it is null, undefined, or equal to the
    constant Boolean.FALSE; and true otherwise. You are encouraged 
    to use regular boolean primitives in your code as these will
    be translated to Boolean.TRUE and Boolean.FALSE during introspection.
    <p>
    Finally, you can group expressions based on Terms and these five
    operators using parentheses, as you would expect. Thus the following
    is a valid condition: (($User && $User.isOK()) || ($Magic == "foo"))
    <p>
<li><b>Integer support.</b> An Integer object will be constructed from a Term 
    when it is fully numeric. For example, if you write:
    <pre>
        #set $a = 10
    </pre>
    that is equivalent to context.put("a", new Integer(10)). You may 
    prefix a value with a minus sign to create negative values. Also, 
    you may construct a Long instead of an Integer by adding the 
    suffix <b>l</b> or <b>L</b>, as in Java. 
    <p>
    An Integer will automatically be converted to an <b>int</b> 
    primitive, so you can use these constants to call methods 
    which require an int argument.
    <p>
    No support is provided for Double, Float, or other values. If you
    wish to write a numeric value as a string, enclose it in quotation
    marks. For example, "101L" is a four character string, whereas 
    101L when used as a Term, is a three digit Integer.
    <p>
    Note that this only applies to Terms: list members, arguments to 
    functions, parameters of directives, etc.; numeric values in running 
    text are unaffected.
    <p>
<li><b>HelloWorld example servlet.</b> Should be easier for new users to 
    configure and get working than the other examples.
    <p>
<li>Bugs fixed: The introspector was ordering overloaded methods 
    incorrectly and selecting the wrong one when multiple matches
    were available--it now selects the most specific method for 
    an objects true type. ParseErrors are now reported with the correct 
    line number and filename; previously it always said line 0.
    <p>
<li>Many error messages have been cleaned up; as has the handling of 
    exceptions on startup. WMServlet now tries really hard to give you
    good advice when something goes wrong during initialization.
    <p>
<li>Minor API changes throughout the system. These should have no effect
    on most users: directives are loaded with Class.forName() in 
    preparation for future extensions; ResourceBroker's internal 
    revocation code now has reasons attached; WMServlet no longer
    throws a ServletException, instead it displays an error message
    to web users; visibility has changed on several classes and methods.
</ul>

Because of the widespread code changes, you will have to recompile your
servlets in order to use the new release. You should not have to make
any modifications to your source code, or to your templates, in this
upgrade.
<p>
As usual, let me know if you find any bugs! I always expect there will 
be a few--and will put out fixes as soon as I can once they're reported.
<p>
Thanks to everyone on the list for all the help!

<p>

<h3>Release 0.85.2</h3>
April 25th, 1999
<p>

This is a maintenance release which fixes several bugs:
<ul>
<li>#if directive sometimes evaluated its argument twice, 
which was silly and sometimes caused problems--now guaranteed to 
evaluate it just once. 
<li>ResourceManager now has public visibility
again--I made it package in the last release, which confused the 
introspector when trying to access $Broker values from a 
template. 
<li>Lists (such as arguments to methods) were not 
recursively evaluating macros within their members, now they do.
<li>You can now use a list (with [ a b c ] syntax) as the list 
argument to a #foreach directive--previously you could only 
use a variable.
</ul>

The documentation was also cleaned up in a few places, mostly
incorrect javadoc comments.
<p>
Other changes: The Macro interface no longer has an isDefined()
method, as it wasn't needed. Many classes and methods have had 
their visibility reduced, to clarify the API and prevent 
undesirable dependencies.
<p>
You will have to recompile your WebMacro servlets to upgrade.
You shouldn't have to make any code changes. If you notice a
template variable that acesses the WebMacro API no longer 
works, I probably got over-zealous in removing public 
visibility somewhere--add it back, and report the bug.
<p>
License note: WebMacro is now directly under the GPL, there 
is no longer any intermediate license. It's simpler this way.
The clause stating that feedback you send to the list may 
be freely used by everyone is now a condition of the list,
rather than WebMacro's usage license. This means nothing if
you are registered as a commercial developer--and practically
nothing if you are using the GPL. (This clause allows me to 
share feedback with non-GPL users, without worrying about
copyright).
<p>
As usual, thanks to everyone on the list who helped track
down these bugs! 
<p>

<h3>Release 0.85.1</h3>
April 17th, 1999
<p>

This release fixes two bugs: meaningless exceptions were being
logged when TemplatePath has multiple directories; iterator() methods
were being ignored by Property introspection when extracting list
from object. Also, the com.semiotek.* sources have been moved into
the org.webmacro.* package. Minor documentation fixes and updates.
<p>
Note that because sources have moved from one package to another,
you should recompile your WebMacro applications against this 
version due to binary incompatibilities. No change to your Java
code itself should be necessary, though.

<h3>Release 0.85</h3>
April 11th, 1999
<p>
This release fixes several bugs, and improves functionality in some simple
but important ways. WebMacro is a lot easier to use now; and better suited 
for use in production environments.     <p>

Here's a list:

<ul>
   <li><b>Reloadable Templates:</b>
 
       You can set the duration of the template loader's cache in 
       the config file (WebMacro.properties). By setting this to
       zero you can disable caching altogether. 
       <p>
       Set "TemplateExpireTime" to zero for development and debugging;
       set it to a non-zero value (10 min recommended) for production
       use.    <p>

   <li><b>WMServlet API</b>

       The WMServlet API has changed to be identical with the old Handler
       API. This is an incompatible change--you will have to modify your
       WMServlet subclasses to compile against this version. 
       <p>
       In particular, the return type of the handle method has changed,
       and you can now throw an exception from it on error. This handle
       method is now identical to the one in the Handler interface.   <p>

   <li><b>Form Variables</b>
       
       In the WebMacro script language the built-in variable $Form
       is now always a scalar String. A new variable has been created,
       $FormList, which is always an iterator.
       <p>
       This is an incompatible change. Any template which had been using 
       a $Form variable as the iterator in a #foreach statement must be
       changed to use $FormList.
       <p>
       This also should end the problems reported with POST data,
       and is more consistent with the Servlet API.   <p>

   <li><b>TemplatePath</b>

       Rather than TemplateDirectory, WebMacro.properties now uses
       a TemplatePath property. This is an incompatible change. You
       must modify your WebMacro.properties file to use the new
       property.
       <p>
       You can specify a whole list of paths separated by your 
       platform path separtor (eg: ";" or ":") similar to your 
       CLASSPATH evironment variable. WebMacro will search all
       directories in this path for a Template. 
       <p>
       Also, the name you pass to the TemplateProvider can incldue
       a subdirectory, such as "foo/hello.wm". This is useful in 
       production environments since it allows you to specify 
       different subdirectories based on the Script Name of your 
       Servlet, allowing you to partition the name space.   <p>

   <li><b>Boolean Constants</b>
       
       A Term can now be one of the constants "true", or "false" (case 
       insensitive).  These constants can be used in #set directives,
       as well as method arguments, and anywhere else a Term is
       allowed. They are equivalent to the objects Boolean.TRUE
       and Boolean.FALSE.
       <p>
       One use of these is to undefine a variable by explicitly
       #setting it to false.    <p>

   <li><b>Java 2</b>

       It is easier to compile  WebMacro against JDK 1.2 now:
       Erase the files in com/semiotek/util/java2, which are 
       all pseudo classes that mirror the JDK1.2 collection API.   <p>

   <li><b>Examples</b>

       The Guestbook example now uses the WMServlet approach; and
       the TestWM template is a little more functional.   <p>

   <li><b>Bug Fixes</b>
       
       Several bugs have been fixed. The most important are:

       <ul>
          <li>A bug which prevented using methods which returned
          Java primitives as arguments to other methods.
          <li>A bug which caused templates to be cached permanently 
          under some conditions, and likely had a similar effect
          on other Providers using the ResourceBroker's caching
          mechanism. 
      </ul>   <p>
</ul>

As usual, thanks to everyone on the list, and keep sending in 
those bug reports!


<h3>Release 0.80.1</h3>
March 7th, 1999
<p>
Minor bug fixes: Error messages are now correctly displayed.

<h3>Release 0.80</h3>
March 5th, 1999
<p>

Changes in this release are on both the back end and the script side.
Many of them have little visible effect, but potentially widespread 
implications--thus you should thorougly test your applications with 
the new 0.80 release before putting it into production use.    <p>

Here's an overview:

<ul>
   <li><b>Generic Servlets:</b>

       This release introduces the servlet.WMServlet class. You can 
       subclass from this rather than implementing Handler and using
       Reactor--if you do, you should be able to register your WMServlet
       subclass as a regular servlet with your servlet engine. This should
       make registration and configuration of WebMacro based servlets 
       much easier than it was in the past. 
       <p>
       If you prefer the old way,
       Reactor still exists (now a subclass of WMServlet) and behaves 
       exactly as before--with Reactor you implement a Handler and 
       register Reactor as your servlet.
       <p>
       The WMServlet base class manages an instance of ResourceBroker 
       that is shared between all instances, so you don't lose any of 
       the benefit of working in the WebMacro framework.   <p>

   <li><b>Template parameters:</b>

       You can use the #param directive to define parameters in your 
       WebMacro templates. You can then access them in your template 
       as a variable, except prefixed with two $'s rather than one 
       (eg: $$myParam). 
       <p>
       The big difference is that they are statically evaluated at 
       parse time, not dynamically evaluated against your context. They
       are also available to your Handler or WMServlet subclass via 
       the Template.getParam(name) call. 
       <p>
       This allows your Handler or WMServlet to query a template to determine
       how information should be processed in order to correctly populate 
       the WebContext. One use of this feature would be to implement a 
       WMServlet subclass that behaves like a server-side-include. In the
       future WebMacro will probably ship with such a subclass as an 
       example application.    <p>

   <li><b>List Initializer Syntax:</b>
      
       You can define lists from within your template using square 
       bracket notation, like this:   <pre>

           #set $myList = [ "first", second, $third ]

       </pre>

       You could also use the initializer syntax directly in a #foreach 
       loop. List initializations can be nested to define lists of lists
       if you so desire. You can also use the list initializer syntax
       with a #param directive to pass a list back to the Handler/WMServlet. <p>

   <li><b>Comments:</b>

       You can put comments in your templates now. A comment is a line 
       beginning with two #'s, like this:   <pre>

            ## this is a comment
       </pre>

       The ## must appear as the first non-whitespace on a line, like any
       other directive. Unfortunately the current implementation is not 
       completely whitespace clean--you will notice an extra blank line 
       in the output in place of your comment. This should be fixed in a 
       future release.
       <p>

   <li><b>Method Invocation:</b>

       You can invoke methods as part of regular property evaluation now. 
       For example: <pre>

            $myVar.property.method( "param", $param, $$param ).property

       </pre>

       When you name an overloaded method, WebMacro will pick the most 
       specific according to the real types of the parameters at runtime.
       This is slightly different than Java, which would pick the most 
       specific according to the declared types of the objects at 
       compile time--but WebMacro is not a strongly typed language, and
       this approximation does what you expect 99.9% of the time.
       <p>
       Please note that method invocation should be used only when there
       is no viable way to use a regular property name. For one thing it 
       is slower. For another, it binds your template to specific knowledge
       about the method signatures of the target object--leaving the 
       programmer with less flexibility in providing the information 
       you requested.
       <p>

   <li><b>Conditionals:</b>

       A slight but important improvement to conditionals: they know about
       Booleans now. You can use 'true' and 'false' to indicate whether
       a condition is true now, rather than just null or not-null. It is
       still acceptable to use null or not-null. 
       <p>
       In conjunction with method calls, this means you should be able
       to write things like $customer.isPaidUp() in conditionals in
       the templates now.
       <p>

   <li><b>Documentation Improvements:</b>

       The Script.html and FAQ.html provide some much needed documentation.
       The former is a reference guide to the script language; the latter
       answers some questions commonly asked on the mailing list.
       <p>

   <li><b>Lesser Changes:</b>

       Technically, a context no longer needs to be a map. You can supply
       any object and the introspector will do what it can with it.
       <p>
       Macros are now recursively evaluated--if evaluate() returns a Macro,
       it will be re-evaluated until a non-Macro is obtained.
       <p>
       You can throw an exception out of Handler.init() if you need to now,
       to indicate that it failed to initialize.
       <p>
       Variables now evaluate to whatever object they actually represent.
       They used to always evaluate to a String. This is a subtle change
       which should have no effect, but has the potential to break things.
       <p>
       Fixed up the display of some error messages and other things. 
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Release 0.75</h3>

Dec. 18th, 1998
<p>
Changes in this release are all on the back end Java processing side, 
but they are substantial: 
<ul>
   <li><b>Component Model.</b> 
   
       WebMacro's core services are largely component based now.
       You can add new components, or replace the default components
       (like URL to handler mapping, locating templates, etc.) with
       your own. Simply implement a new ResourceProvider and add
       it to the config file instead of, or in addition to the
       providers that ship with WebMacro.  <p>

       The ResourceBroker shares resources between handlers, caches 
       them, expires them over time, and segregates providers of 
       information from their consumers.  <p>

       It also introduces the possibility of concurrency within
       the same servlet, as it is capable of resolving a request
       for information asynchronously. For example, you could open 
       a network connection to a database while reading your template.
       Your handler won't block until it actually attempts to access
       the requested information.  <p>

   <li><b>Smarter Introspection.</b>

       The Property class has been totally rewritten. It has all of 
       the old behavior, plus two new features:  <p>

       First, you can now use an array/enumeration/iterator as a
       list (previously you had to have an "elements()" or "iterator()"
       method that returned one). Now if you have a getCustomers() 
       method that returns an enumeration, you can use that method 
       with #foreach to iterate through your customers.  <p>

       Second, "binary" property introspection is now supported. Basic
       introspection means the presence of a getFoo method means $Foo 
       will work as a variable. "Binary" introspection means that if 
       you have a getFoo("Bar") method $Foo.Bar works. This is especially
       useful in the case of methods like getHeader("Referer"). It also
       works for setting a value: setThing("name", value) can be 
       called as #set Thing.name = value from the script language.
       <p>

   <li><b>Refactoring.</b> 
   
       There have been slight changes to the back end design. Many
       of the core system classes have been completely redesigned
       to fit into the ResourceBroker component model. The most
       noticible changes are that TemplateStore and Config have
       disappeared from sight--they are now accessed by way of the
       ResourceBroker (the "template" and "config" resources).  <p>

   <li><b>Bug fixes.</b>

       Lots of minor bugs have been squashed. Many people on the 
       WebMacro mailing list pointed out problems, and they've 
       been fixed--keep sending in those reports! I encourage 
       everyone to subscribe to the list and post their problems, 
       suggestions, etc.  <p>

   <li><b>License Fix</b>

       WebMacro can be distributed under a variety of licenses, including
       the GPL. So when you submit bugs and suggestions I need the right 
       to use them! The old license gave me the right to reuse <i>anything</i>
       people submitted--which was way to broad. You should be able to send
       in something like a module without giving up any rights to it at 
       all. The new license makes it clear that you can send in stuff under
       your own license, and I'll happily include it in the distribution 
       if your license allows it. Without some other indication to 
       the contrary, I still get to use bug fixes/suggestions/etc. without
       having anyone fill out any forms.
       <p>
</ul>

<h3>Release 0.70</h3>

Nov. 19th, 1998 <p>

This release is better tested and easier to use than the previous release. It
also has some hope of running under NT, as file separator and line separator
bugs have been fixed. It has been tested under Linux and FreeBSD, and will
be tested under NT and Solaris soon (but hasn't yet been).  <p>

We've included some examples for you to look at, and cleaned up the 
API documentation quite a bit--however we haven't got around to writing
a proper user manual yet either for graphics designers or programmers.<p>

Please bear with us -- this is an experimental early release. We believe
it will work for you, but can't promise anything. In particular you 
probably should use it for production systems yet, as it may contain
bugs. You've been warned.  <p>

See the <a href="License.html">LICENSE</a> file for details about your 
rights and obligations with respect to the software (for example, your
right to use it under the GPL), plus legal disclaimers, and so forth. <p>

If you are interested in using WebMacro, we'd like you to join our 
<a href="http://lists.semiotek.com/mailman/listinfo/webmacro">mailing list</a> and send us some feedback.  <p>

We hope you like it!   <p>
