<h1><font color="green">WebMacro: Project Status</font></h1>

WARNING: <b><font color="red">WebMacro versions pre-1.0 are experimental early releases.</font></b>
<p>
Version 0.89.1, released May 3rd, fixes a bug in the new conditional code
<p>
Version 0.89, released May 2nd 1999, adds conditional logic, 
tests for equality and inequality, integer support, fixes many
bugs, and cleans up error reporting.  
<p>

Version 0.85.2, released April 25th 1999, fixes bugs and tightens
up the source. Bugs fixed: #foreach can now take a list as its
argument; macros within lists properly expanded; #if is now 
guaranteed to evaluate its argument only once; and restored
public visibilityto ResourceManager.
<p>

Version 0.85.1, released April 17th 1999, fixes a few small bugs:
meaningless exceptions were being logged when TemplatePath has
multiple directories; iterator() methods were being ignored by
Property introspection when extracting list from object.  
<p>

Version 0.85, released April 11th 1999, adds reloadable templates,
cleans up the WMServlet API, adds template paths, makes it easier
to compile under Java 2, and fixes several nasty bugs.
<p>

Version 0.80, released March 5th 1999, adds generic servlets, template
parameters, method invocation, list initialization, comments, and 
numerous smaller changes. The 0.80.1 release on March 7 fixes a minor
bug in error rendering.<p>

Version 0.75.3 fixes a bug that caused JavaScript programs embedded in 
WebMacro scripts to break (a problem with { and } in some contexts.). <p>

Version 0.75.2 fixes a lot of bugs that were reported on the mailing 
list, and adds one new feature: If the result of evaluating a Variable 
is a Macro, it is recursively evaluated; otherwise Object.toString() 
is used to acquire a value. Previously only Object.toString() was used.
The bugs fixed included problems with the #use directive, parse errors 
associated with the #if directive, improper handling of tabs, and 
a variety of less critical bugs. <p>

Version 0.75.1 fixes a bug in the parser that was present in the 
first 0.75 release of WebMacro. Newlines in nested blocks were not 
handled correctly, leading to a failure to recognize the closing 
brace.  <p>

Version 0.75 of WebMacro adds a flexible component model to the
development side. The new ResourceBroker manages a cache of resources
shared between multiple connctions; allows expensive resources to
be retrieved asynchronously, blocking your servlet only when it
attempts to access the requested information.  <p>

In addition, with the ResourceBroker you can replace any of the
core components within WebMacro with your own versions. You can also
write new core functionality and add it to the system.  <p>

On the front end, the template script language has much faster and
smarter property introspection: it's capable of extracting much more
information from arbitrary Java objects, and it does so more quickly. <p>

And we've now tested on more platforms: Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and NT!

Version numbers of WebMacro pre-1.0 will indicate what percent of the way
we think we are to having a stable 1.0 release. To get to 1.0 we 
still have to: 

<ul>
  <li>Fix bugs and test! We need help here--if you run into any problems,
      please report them on the mailing list. Otherwise we don't know!
      <p>
  <li>Smarter conditionals. WebMacro if statements are limited to simple
      true or false (returned from a method, or in a variable). It should
      support the full suite of and/or/not operators.
      <p>  
  <li>It should be possible to build static pages out of WebMacro 
      templates, in conjunction with a database of some sort. It would 
      also be good if templates could be generated programatically, 
      not just read from a file. This may or may not make it into 1.0.
      <p>
  <li>Better support for distributed servlets. Primrily, using URLs rather
      than just file names to load resources.
      <p>
  <li>WebMacro should ship with better examples, possibly even some simple
      but useful common applications.
      <p>
  <li>Better documentation. The API and script documentation are pretty 
      good now--but there should be a better tutorial and other things.
</ul>

Between now and 1.0 we reserve the right to change any interface, rewrite
any class, modify the format of the config file, alter the template script
language, etc. 
<p>
To shield people from the worst of this, we've marked many classes as 
"final" unnecessarily, and marked many constructors as protected. As the 
interfaces stabilize, these restrictions will be removed.
<p>
After 1.0 we will try really really hard not to break anyone's existing
code. So be warned: WebMacro pre 1.0 is still experimental "beta" software
that continues to undergo substantial transformations.
<p>
On the other hand, the current version is pretty good. A great deal of 
functionality is in place, and you should be able to put it to productive
use.
