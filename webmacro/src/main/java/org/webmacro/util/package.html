Classes to simplify evaluation, settings, logging, encoding/decoding and escaping.

WMEval, WMStringEval simplify template evaluation. The former handles
more complex resource-based templates with
an output stream; the latter is for simple string-based templates
with output to a string. SparseProperties provides for a default value
for a missing key; numerous logging classes are included; and an excellent
settings sysem used by WebMacro allowing for wildcard evaluation of a
setting sub-type.
