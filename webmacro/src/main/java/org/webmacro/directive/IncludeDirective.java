/**
 * IncludeDirective allows you to include other text files or Templates into
 * the current Template.
 * <p>
 * Syntax:<pre>
 *    #include [as text|template|macro] quoted-string-variable
 *</pre>
 *
 * <code>IncludeDirective</code> has 4 modes of operation which are detailed
 * below.<p>
 *
 * Please note that #include is now the preferred way to include files or
 * templates.  Although you can still use #parse (in the same manner as
 * described below), its use has been deprecated.<p>
 *
 * <b>Including as text</b><br>
 * Including a file as text causes the raw bytes of the file to be included
 * in the current template.  The file is <b>not</b> considered to be a Template,
 * and is not parsed by WebMacro.  This allows you to include external files
 * that contain javascript or stylesheets without fear of mangling by WebMacro's
 * parser.<p>
 *
 * Files included as text are found using the default <code>URLProvider</code>.
 * If the URLProvider cannot find the file, the Broker is asked to find it.
 * This allows you to include files from any of the following places:
 * <li>other websites
 * <li>local filesystem
 * <li>active classpath<p>
 *
 * Files included as text are located once.  Changes to the included file
 * will not be found by WebMacro!<p>
 *
 * Examples:<pre>
 *
 *   // include your system password file (not a good idea! :)
 *   #include as text "/etc/password"
 *
 *   // include the WebMacro homepage
 *   #include as text "http://www.webmacro.org"
 *
 *   // inlude a file that is in your classpath
 *   #include as text "somefile.txt"
 *
 * </pre><br>
 *
 * <b>Including as template</b><br>
 * Including a file as template causes the file to be parsed and evaluated
 * by WebMacro using the current <code>Context</code>.  The evaluated output of
 * the Template is included in your main template.<p>
 *
 * Please note that files included "as template" that contains #macro's <b>DO NOT</b>
 * make their #macro's available to the outer template.  See "Including as macro" below
 * for this.<p>
 *
 * Files included as template are found in your <code>TemplatePath</code>.
 * This path, if not explicitly set in <code>WebMacro.properties</code>, defaults
 * to the system classpath (standalone and JSDK 1.0), or the "web-app" directory
 * (JSDK 2.x).<p>
 *
 * Files included as templates are located and conditionally reloaded/parsed when
 * they change.<p>
 *
 * Examples:<pre>
 *
 *   // include a global header template
 *   #include as template "header.wm"
 *
 *   // include a header template from a subdirectory of your TemplatePath
 *   #include as template "common/header.wm"
 *
 *   // include a header template using an absolute path in your TemplatePath
 *   #include as template "/mysite/common/header.wm"
 *
 * </pre><br>
 *
 * <b>Including as macro</b><br>
 * Including a file as a macro is similiar to the above, except that #macro's
 * defined in the included file <b>are</b> made available to the outer template.
 * "Macro" templates are found using the same TemplatePath settings as
 * "#include as template".<p>
 *
 * Files included as macros are located once.  Changes to the included template
 * will not be found by WebMacro!<p>
 *
 * Exapmles:<pre>
 *
 *   // include a template with macros
 *   #include as macro "my_macros.wm"
 *
 * </pre><br>
 *
 *
 * <b>Including without qualification</b><br></a>
 * Including a file without first qualifing it as a <i>text</i> file or
 * <i>template</i> causes <code>IncludeDirective</code> to make some educated
 * guesses about what type of file it is.<p>
 *
 * If the filename contains <code>://</code>, it is assumed to be a URL and is
 * treated as if it were a <code>text</code> file.<p>
 *
 * Else if the filename ends with any of the configured template file extensions
 * (see below), it is assumed to be a template.<p>
 *
 * Else it is assumed to be <code>text</code>.<p>
 *
 * Examples:<pre>
 *
 *    // include homepage of WebMacro -- assumed to be "as text"
 *    #include "http://www.webmacro.org/"
 *
 *    // include a template -- assumed to be "as template"
 *    #include "header.wm"
 *
 *    // include a text file from local filesystem -- assumed to be "as text"
 *    #include "somefile.txt"
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <b><code>WebMacro.properties</code> Configuration Options</b><br>
 *
 * <code>include.TemplateExtensions</code>: list of file extensions<br>
 * This list of file extensions is used to determine the file type of an
 * unqualified #include'd file.<p>
 *
 * The default set of extensions are: <code>wm, wmt, tml</code>
 *
 * @author <a href=mailto:ebr@tcdi.com>Eric B. Ridge</a>
 * @since the beginning, but consolidated with #parse post 0.97
