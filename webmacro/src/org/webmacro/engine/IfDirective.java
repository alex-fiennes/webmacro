/**
  * An if directive is used to include a block only when a condition 
  * is true. Structurally it has a condition, followed by a block, 
  * followed by an optional "#else" statmeent and another block.
  * 
  * Here is an example:<pre>
  *
  *     #if ($userID) {
  *        Your user id is: $userID
  *     } #else {
  *        &lt;a href="register"&gt;Click here to register&lt;/a&gt;
  *     }
  *
  * </pre> The condition is true if it evaluates to a non-null value. The 
  * #if block will be included if (and only if) the condition evaluates
  * to a non-null value. The #else block will be included if (and
  * only if) the condition evaluates to null.
  * <p>
  * When evaluating whether a condition is null or not, the IfDirective
  * will check whether it is a Macro. If it is a Macro, it calls 
  * Macro.evaluate() and checks whether the return value is null. If 
  * it is not a macro, then it is true or false simply based on whether
  * the value passed in was actually null itself.
  * <p>
  * @see Macro
