/**
  * Template objects represent the user defined layout into which the 
  * webmacro package will substitute values. It is a very simple kind of
  * interpreted language containing text, blocks, and directives. Text is
  * to be passed through verbatim. LList group text and directives into
  * linear lists and sublists. Directives determine how subsequent blocks
  * are to be processed and constitute the commands of the language. 
  * <p>
  * The Template is lazily evaluated: it does not parse or open the 
  * supplied filename until it is used. Once it has parsed the file, it 
  * never alters its data. The intent is to allow a Template to be parsed
  * once (somewhat expensive) and then used many times; and also not to 
  * incur any parsing costs at all if the Template is never actually used.
