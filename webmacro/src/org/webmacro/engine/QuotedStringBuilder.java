/**
 * A quoted string is a vector of strings and macros. When parsing,
 * it begins with a quotation mark and extends until a matching
 * close quotation mark (single or double quotes accepted, the
 * close quote must match the open quote).
 * <p>
 * When parsing, you can use the escape character to protect values
 * that might otherwise be interepreted. The escape character is \
 * <p>
 * It usually contains a series of strings and variables. If you put
 * a Macro into it, the Macro.evaluate()/Macro.write() method will
 * be used to include its contents. If you include a non-Macro,
 * its Object.toString() method will be used instead.
 * <p>
 * Unix users should note that there is no difference between double
 * and single quotes with quoted string. It is more like the quoting
 * used for HTML attributes. Internal variables are alway evaluated.
 * <p>
 * Examples:<pre>
 *
 *    #include 'this is a quoted string with a $variable in it'
 *    #include "use double quotes and you can put don't in it"
 *    #include "use the escape char to write \$10 in a QuotedString"
 *
 * </pre>Here the text inside the quotes is the QuotedString.
