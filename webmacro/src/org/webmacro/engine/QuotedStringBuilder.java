/**
  * A quoted string is a vector of strings and macros. When parsing,
  * it begins with a quotation mark and extends until a matching 
  * close quotation mark (single or double quotes accepted, the 
  * close quote must match the open quote). 
  * <p>
  * When parsing, you can use the escape character to protect values
  * that might otherwise be interepreted. The escape character is \
  * <p>
  * It usually contains a series of strings and variables. If you put
  * a Macro into it, the Macro.evaluate()/Macro.write() method will 
  * be used to include its contents. If you include a non-Macro, 
  * its Object.toString() method will be used instead.
  * <p>
  * Unix users should note that there is no difference between double 
  * and single quotes with quoted string. It is more like the quoting 
  * used for HTML attributes. Internal variables are alway evaluated.
  * <p>
  * Examples:<pre>
  *
  *    #include 'this is a quoted string with a $variable in it'
  *    #include "use double quotes and you can put don't in it"
  *    #include "use the escape char to write \$10 in a QuotedString"
  *
  * </pre>Here the text inside the quotes is the QuotedString.
