/**
  * Resource Broker--connect up requests for a particular type of 
  * resource with a provider capable of obtaining it.
  * It also manages a cache of resources, frees them over time, 
  * and ensures that their Providers have an opportunity to save them.
  * <p>
  * A "resource" is an object which can be uniquely identified by a 
  * string type and a string name.
  * <p>
  * The ResourceBroker is strongly related to the Java InfoBus. The
  * InfoBus was intended to be used in applets, and has many Applet
  * specific properties. Like the InfoBus a ResourceBroker is intended
  * to allow you to exchange data by name, between providers and 
  * client programs--enabling you to change providers/client at runtime,
  * have multiple providers for the same kind of information, and allow
  * multiple clients of information to share the same copy of the data.
  * Though the ResourceBroker and InfoBus differ in many other ways, one
  * intent of the ResourceBroker design is that it could make use of an
  * InfoBus internally, proxying requests so transparently that clients
  * of the ResourceBroker would not know they were using an InfoBus. This
  * is important because many useful classes may be written for the InfoBus
  * in the near future.
  * <p>
  * Unlike the InfoBus, the ResourceBroker handles requests asynchronously,
  * starting a new thread for each request. It also manages a simple cache,
  * and automatically revokes objects that have not been accessed (according
  * to a strict definition of "accessed") within a fixed period of time.
  * <p>
  * The ResourceBroker attempts some simple thread scheduling. The thread 
  * spawned off to do the work happens at less than the default 
  * thread priority. If a thread blocks waiting for it to 
  * complete in the ResourceEvent.getValue() method, the priority of the 
  * worker thread trying to acquire the resource is raised to be
  * greater than the default priority.
  * <p>
  * The broker also manages a resource cache. If two clients request
  * the same resource (identical name and type) then they get back the
  * same resource. To accomplish this, the broker maintains a cache of
  * outstanding objects. 
  * <p>
  * The ResourceBroker runs a reaper thread in the background for each
  * resource type, to revoke resources which have not been used recently.  
  * You can specify what "recently" means as an argument to the constructor. 
  * You can override that choice for each specific type when you register 
  * the FIRST provider of that type. 
  * <p>
  * Please note that revoking does NOT mean the underlying objects are 
  * freed--only that the ResourceBroker will not permit any new accesses 
  * to them, ask their provider to save them, and cause their corresponding 
  * ResourceEvents to throw a ResourceRevokedException whenever an attempt 
  * is made to access its value. You could still go and get a NEW reference
  * to it by calling request() and have a fresh working copy. The object 
  * will not be freed by the JVM until the last reference to it is lost by 
  * its client--but this will be convenient in many instances, such as 
  * threaded servlets, * where references are lost quite quickly.
  * <p>
  * An object is revoked if it has not been touched since the last time 
  * the reaper looked at it. A resource is "touched" when you call a 
  * method on its ResourceEvent (eg: getValue, isAvailable, etc.). This
  * policy can be extended by the ResourceProvider, since a ResourceEvent
  * supports both the Observer and PropertyChangeListener interfaces: A 
  * provider could supply resource objects that support the complementary
  * interfaces and register them with the ResourceEvent when setting them.
  * <p>
  * Some segments of code may find it inconvenient that a resource can 
  * be revoked at any time. To make life easier for these applications, 
  * there is a getValue(type,name) method available which blocks until
  * the object becomes available, and attempts to deal with the fact that
  * it has been revoked.
  * <p>
  * <b>Thread policy:</b> NEVER lock this object.
  * <p>
  * You MAY lock on ResourceEvents under limited conditions--in
  * particular if you hold a lock on an event, you MUST NOT use the
  * broker at all while you have that lock, nor may you call any
  * method which will use the broker. The broker will lock ResourceEvents
  * under a variety of conditions; this policy ensures that locks
  * are always acquired in the same order: Broker lock first,
  * lock ResourceEVent second.  
  * <p>
  * <b>NOTE</b>: While the ResourceBroker takes steps to ensure that 
  * a ResourceEvent is saved before it is revoked, it has no way of 
  * detecting activity on the underlying object, nor can it prevent 
  * clients from extracting the underlying resource from a 
  * ResourceEvent and holding copies of it after it has been revoked.
  * <p>
