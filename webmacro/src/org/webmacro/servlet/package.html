Classes to support execution of WebMacro in a servlet container.

This package contains a number of tools which are context helpers,
servlet base classes, viewers and a subclass of the WebMacro context
supporting evaluation of a template within a servlet container.

TemplateServlet, WMServlet, and ServletRouter are designed to accelerate
servlet devlopment. A WebContext will automatically contain references
to web request variables, the session, a cookie handler, and the
response object. For developers coming over from perl and legacy cgi
environments, see the class file CGI_Impersonator to discover
what methods in the Request object map to legacy CGI function calls.
