  -- javac does not like WebContext with final methods and nested 
     classes. It likes it fine if the classes are not nested. So I need
     to move those nested classes out... it works with jikes. i have
     confirmed that this is a bug in javac by checking the sun list 
     of bugs. 

     I would like to have CGI_Impersonator and so on members of the 
     WebContext so that I don't have to create new instances of the 
     variables they require... there is a very slight efficiency 
     pentalty in my choice to continue supporting javac until this
     bug is fixed.
