/**
  * Framework for handling template requests, requested by reactor. 
  * Anything which implements this interface can be used as a handler
  * to process web requests.
  * <p>
  * How to use:
  * <ol>
  * <li>. Define a name for your new Handler. It must be alphanumeric.
  * <li>. Set that to be a valid servlet name for WebMacro in your 
  *    servlet.properties file (if using servletrunner, otherwise 
  *    name your servlet this using the interface in your runner)
  * <li>. Set the script prefix to be the prefix added by servletrunner
  *    in the config file. eg: "ScriptName = /servlet/"
  * <li>. Register your Handler against the Reactor class by calling
  *    Reactor.register(handler) 
  * </ol>
  * <p>
  * When a request comes in, WebMacro loads the handler that matches
  * the script name of the request. It will search the ClassPath looking
  * for a script with the same fully qualified name as the script name,
  * which more or less means your handler should probably not be in any
  * particular package.
  * <p>
  * @see GenericHandler

     * <p>
     * If you throw an Exception it will be used to provide an explanation
     * to the user of why the failure occurred. The HandlerException class
     * provides you with numerous options for reporting errors.
