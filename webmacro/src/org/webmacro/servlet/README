 -- Classes that relate to the WebMacro servlet specifically, including
    how the system bootstraps itself, configures itself, accepts
    connections, and constructs the framework from which a servlet 
    author works.

   Reactor: This is the WebMacro servlet. You have to get it running.

   Handler: You subclass this to write your applicaton.

   Config:  Allows you to access configuration data.

   WebContext: What you get to work with when a request comes along
