<b>Abstract: Why was this release released?</b>
<p>
This is the third 1.0 release candidate.  This means you should find this 
release of Webmacro to be very stable, and of production quality.
We are not calling it a 1.0 final release until a majority of our 
user base has had a chance to really test it. Release Candidate 1
was released around the first of October and is exceptionally stable.

A few improvements have been made for this release, RC3. They are documented
in the release notes and other relevant release documents to help you with WM. 
WM is a very stable platform with several years of development and testing 
under its belt.

Should you encounter problems/bugs, you should submit a bug report to
http://www.webmacro.org/bugzilla/

<p>
Generally, there are no new "features" going in to 
WM.  Until 1.0final, we are in a bug-fix only mode.<p>

WM is easy to use once you get the hang of it. If you are first time user, this release
will not be hard to get working. If you've been using release 0.97+, you can pretty 
much replace your webmacro.jar with the one in this release.
