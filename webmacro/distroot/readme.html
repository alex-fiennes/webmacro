<li>Abstract: Why was this release released?
<br>
This is a 1.0 release candidate.  This means you should find this release of Webmacro
to be very stable, and of production quality.  We are not calling it a 1.0 final release
until a majority of our user base has had a chance to really test it.

Should you encounter problems/bugs, you should submit a bug report to
http://www.webmacro.org/bugzilla/

<p>
Generally, there are no new "features" going in to WM. It is quite extensible
and you can write your own directives if you need to.  However, this release brings
a large set of bugfixes, and a few new "features".  :)  See the RELEASE NOTES for 
details.

<p>
WM is easy to use once you get the hang of it. If you are first time user, this release
will not be hard to get working. If you've been using release 0.97+, you can pretty 
much replace your webmacro.jar with the one in this release.
