<li>Build Date:  3 - July - 2001
<li>Release Number: 0.98

<li>Abstract: Why was this release released?
<br>
This release was in response primarily to white space handling. Many
thanks to Brian, Eric and others who helped to refine a specification
for white space handling. There are
explicit rules for white space handling. These rules were recently posted
on the list and hopefully are documented on the wiki site.
<p>
This release poses the question "Is WM ready for Release One"? You be the
judge. There is a general consensus that Release One is long overdue
and that WM adoption is impaired without a release one. So, please make this
release one that you test and feel confident about its stability. 
<a href=http://www.webmacro.org/bugzilla/>Report bugs</a>
to Bugzilla on the WebMacro wiki site. Many, many thanks to the countless
hours Eric Ridge has put into WM for Bugzilla and other behind-the-scenes
support.
<p>
Generally, there are no new "features" going in to WM. It is quite extensible
and you can write your own directives if you need to.
<p>
WM is easy to use once you get the hang of it. If you are first time user, this release
will not be hard to get working. If you have been using release 0.97, you can pretty 
much replace your webmacro.jar with the one in this release.
