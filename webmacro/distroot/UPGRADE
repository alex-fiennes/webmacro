Potential Pitfalls While Ugrading
---------------------------------

If you are upgrading from early versions of WebMacro, you should
probably read this file. 

Since WebMacro 1.0, only 1 minor API change has been made.  WebMacro's
simple logging API has been changed to accept "Throwable"s instead of 
"Exceptions".  This only impacts those who have implemented their own
LogTargets.  If you have implemeted your own LogTargets, or have otherwise
referenced the org.webmacro.Log object (either directory or indirectly), 
you will need to recompile _your_ code base.

Beyond this, no other public API changes have been made.
