Potential Pitfalls While Ugrading
---------------------------------

1) WebMacro no longer requires a "WebMacro.properties" file (it is
completely optional).  WebMacro now has a "WebMacro.defaults" file that
is included in the .jar file.  This file is used as a base for WM's
configuration.  If you find you need to change values, simply create a 
"WebMacro.properties" file and include *only* the keys you need to change.
WM will combine these two files to form the final configuration.

This also means you don't need to configure a TemplatePath, so long as you
meet one of the following requirements:

   1) Using WM in standalone mode, your templates are accessible via the
   system CLASSPATH; or
   
   2) Subclassing WMServlet in a Servlet 2.0 environment (Apache/JServ), 
   your templates are available via your servlet container CLASSPATH; or
   
   3) Subclassing WMServlet in a Servlet 2.1+ environment (Turbine or Resin), 
   your templates are available in your "application directory".  Depending
   on your servlet engine, this could be your WEB-INF/ directory, or your 
   "htdocs" directory.

However, if you don't like WM doing this for you, you can simply add a
"TemplatePath: /path/to/templates" in your custom WebMacro.properties file.


2) If you are using WebMacro in standalone mode (ie, not subclassing
WMServlet), you are most likely using a FastWriter.  The signatures for
FastWriter's constructors have changed to include a Broker:
   public FastWriter(Broker broker, OutputStream out, String encoding)

Your code can be easily adjusted by simply passing in the Broker returned
from the getBroker() method of your WebMacro instance:
   FastWriter fw = new FastWriter (_wm.getBroker(), System.out, "UTF8");
    
    
3) If you are sublcassing WMServlet, your handle() method most likely
contains something like this at the end:
      ...
   Template t;
   try {
      t = getTemplate ("mytemplate.wm")   
   } catch (NotFoundExceptoin nfe) {
      System.err.println ("mytemplate.wm could not be found!");
   }
   
   return t;
   
the getTemplate() method of WMServlet now throws a ResourceException, instead
of a NotFoundException.  Simply change your catch block to catch the
ResourceException and you'll be just fine.


4) org.webmacro.Context now implements java.util.Map.  This change, although
it won't adversly affect how you use the Context object, will *require*
you to recompile all your classes that use org.webmacro.Context.  Sorry
for the inconvienence.
