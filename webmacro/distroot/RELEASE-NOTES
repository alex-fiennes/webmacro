WebMacro 2.0
---------------
                    
This is WebMacro 2.0b1, the first beta release of WebMacro 2.0.  Although
we beleive this release to be very stable (and many of us are using it in production
environments), there are likely bugs.  Please report bugs to our subscriber-only
mailing list.  Please visit http://www.webmacro.org/MailingList for details.

WM 2.0 includes new features such as #templet, #eval, syntax-level map support
and numerous bugfixes and improved web docs.


The best place for information about WebMacro is our website:
    http://www.webmacro.org/

In addition, WebMacro has relocated the management aspects of the project to
SourceForge (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/webmacro/).  We hope this
will prove to give the WebMacro community continued support.  We also hope
it will make our lives a bit easier!

Please note that our mailing list, thanks to the increase in SPAM, is now
subscriber-only.  We apologize for any inconvienence, but beleive that it provides
a safer community.  Please visit http://www.webmacro.org/MailingList for details.

Changes in this Release
-----------------------

- Some small signature changes to methods require you to recompile
source code which imports files from webmacro.jar

- WebMacro now has a dependency on Doug Lea's "concurrent.jar".  This library
is used internally by WebMacro to manage many of the concurrency issues inherent to
web development.  Although "concurrent.jar" is included with WebMacro, you
can read about the library here:
    http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html

- WebMacro 2.0 now has first-class support for creating Maps:
    #set $foo = {"key" : "value", "key2" : "value", "keyN" : value }
Creating an empty map:
    #set $foo = { }
Map definitions can also span multiple lines:
    #set $foo = {"key" : "value",
                 "key2" : "value",
                 "keyN" : value }

- You can build WM in a minimalist fashion for embedded systems. See
the ant file for this.

- A powerul new feature has been added allowing for blocks
to be created as templets and evaluated. This is addition to the
macro calling facility.

- In addition to WMServlet.java, a servlet TemplateServlet.java is
in the distro. It shows how to improve performance by creating an
immutable global context which acts as constants context for the life
of the application (or until it is refreshed). 

- Generally, this release represents a very stable runtime for
use as an embedded text processing engine in any context, web or otherwise.
