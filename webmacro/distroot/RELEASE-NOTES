WebMacro 0.98p1
------------
                    
This is a patch release for WebMacro 0.98 that fixes various whitespace handling
bugs. 


Changes in this Release
-----------------------

- Bug fixes to parse exceptions being thrown by new whitespace handling




Recent Changes up to this Release
---------------------------------

- Improved #include directive.  #parse has been deprecated.  #include directive
can now do everything #parse did along with what #include has always done.  See 
the javadocs for org.webmacro.directive.IncludeDirective for usage information.

Note that although #parse has been deprecated, it is still configured for use.  
However, you should replace #parse with #include in your templates

- Improved whitespace handling.  
See http://www.servlets.com/archive/servlet/ReadMsg?msgId=111505&listName=webmacro
for an explanation of how it works.

- added a #type directive that allows template to force the class type
of Context variables.  See the javadocs for org.webmacro.directive.TypeDirective
for usage information.

- org.webmacro.Broker now has a local cache where you can store untyped state 
information that needs to be tied to a specific Broker (WebMacro) instance.

- Directives can now get the name they've been configured as (which could be
different than the name specified by the DirectiveDescriptor) by calling
(in build()):
   String myName = builder.getName();

- Fixed bug #37 in WMServlet where getOutputStream() was being called before the 
content-type was being set.  This is violation of the JSDK 2.3 spec.

- Removed old, unused sources related to the old parser

- New Context Tools:  $Math, $Variable, $Type, and $Text.  See the javadocs
for org.webmacro.MathTool, VariableTool, TypeTool, and TextTool for
usage information.

- the directives #encode, #escape, and #silence are disabled by default.
They are currently broken, and the same result can be acheived using the
$Text tool:
   $Text.URLEncode("Some String value here")
   $Text.HTMLEncode("Some <html> text here")
  
- numerous bug fixes to the parser

- tighter integration with the EvaluationExceptionHandler

- improved logging messages

- Refactor Broker to allow tighter integration with servlet containers -- load 
templates, property files from WAR file or servlet zone, log to servlet log;

- Pluggable cache manager interface -- use for resources, encodings, 
PropertyOperator?; multiple cache managers include VeryFastCache; expose cache
configuration parameters so administrators can tweak them

- Simplified configuration mechanism for Providers, Directives, Tools, Parsers

- Use broker to laod templates, property files

- Make LogFormat? configurable; allow logging to servlet log 

- Better error handling; filter exceptions through EvaluationExceptionHandler?, 
reset output when template evaluation throws so the user can see what happened

- CheckTemplate? tool, StreamTemplate? and TemplateDumper? tools

- ANT build support

- JUnit test framework

- More defaults so its harder to misconfigure WM

- performance enhancements

- Improved block syntax -- #if .. #else .. #endif

- Do arithmetic as int instead of long

- Allow access to .length field of arrays

- TemplatePath? is now optional; you can run WM with an empty .properties

- Load settings from system properties and web.xml as well as .properties
