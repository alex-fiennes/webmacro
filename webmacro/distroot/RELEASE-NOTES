WebMacro 2.0
---------------
                    
This is WebMacro 2.0.

WM 2.0 includes new features such as #templet, #eval, and numerous bugfixes and
better web docs.


The best place for information about WebMacro is our website:
    http://www.webmacro.org/

In addition, WebMacro has relocated the management aspects of the project to
SourceForge (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/webmacro/).  We hope this
will prove to give the WebMacro community continued support.  We also hope
it will make our lives a bit easier!

Note that because of the move to SourceForge our mailing list address has changed.  
Please visit http://www.webmacro.org/MailingList for details.

Changes in this Release
-----------------------

- You can build WM in a minimalist fashion for embedded systems. See
the ant file for this.

- A powerul new feature has been added allowing for blocks
to be created as templets and evaluated. This is addition to the
macro calling facility.

- Some small signature changes to methods require you to recompile
source code which imports files from webmacro.jar

- In addition to WMServlet.java, a servlet TemplateServlet.java is
in the distro. It shows how to improve performance by creating an
immutable global context which acts as constants context for the life
of the application (or until it is refreshed). 

- Generally, this release represents a very stable runtime for
use as an embedded text processing engine in any context, web or otherwise.
