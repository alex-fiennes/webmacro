WebMacro 1.0rc1
------------
                    
This is the first 1.0 release canidate.  We've worked hard to get here, and
we hope WebMacro will (continue to) work hard for you.

Should you encounter problems with this release, please submit a bug report
to http://www.webmacro.org/bugzilla/.

Changes in this Release
-----------------------

- Numerous fixes to how WebMacro handles input/output encoding.  Your DBCS
templates should work now! (sebastian)

- Bug fixes to parse exceptions being thrown by new whitespace handling (sebastian)
 
- Improved logging output.  All log output contains line.column information
for the causing $variable.  Error messages have been reworded to be easier
to understand. (brian)

- Many whitespace parsing fixes involving #comments, #directives, and $variables. (brian)

- Configurable security options for limiting which methods can be called on a class.
This allows the administrator of the WebMacro server to make sure his users don't
abuse the system.  See webmacro.defaults (http://www.webmacro.org/WebMacroDefaults)
for details. (keats)

- Pluggable LogTargets.  You can (finally) plug in your own org.webmacro.util.LogTarget.
By default, WebMacro logs to stderr. (eric)


Recent Changes up to this Release
---------------------------------

- Improved #include directive.  #parse has been deprecated.  #include directive
can now do everything #parse did along with what #include has always done.  See 
the javadocs for org.webmacro.directive.IncludeDirective for usage information.

Note that although #parse has been deprecated, it is still configured for use.  
However, you should replace #parse with #include in your templates

- Improved whitespace handling.  
See http://www.servlets.com/archive/servlet/ReadMsg?msgId=111505&listName=webmacro
for an explanation of how it works.

- added a #type directive that allows template to force the class type
of Context variables.  See the javadocs for org.webmacro.directive.TypeDirective
for usage information.

- org.webmacro.Broker now has a local cache where you can store untyped state 
information that needs to be tied to a specific Broker (WebMacro) instance.

- Directives can now get the name they've been configured as (which could be
different than the name specified by the DirectiveDescriptor) by calling
(in build()):
   String myName = builder.getName();

- Fixed bug #37 in WMServlet where getOutputStream() was being called before the 
content-type was being set.  This is violation of the JSDK 2.3 spec.

- Removed old, unused sources related to the old parser

- New Context Tools:  $Math, $Variable, $Type, and $Text.  See the javadocs
for org.webmacro.MathTool, VariableTool, TypeTool, and TextTool for
usage information.

- the directives #encode, #escape, and #silence are disabled by default.
They are currently broken, and the same result can be acheived using the
$Text tool:
   $Text.URLEncode("Some String value here")
   $Text.HTMLEncode("Some <html> text here")
  
- numerous bug fixes to the parser

- tighter integration with the EvaluationExceptionHandler

- improved logging messages

- Refactor Broker to allow tighter integration with servlet containers -- load 
templates, property files from WAR file or servlet zone, log to servlet log;

- Pluggable cache manager interface -- use for resources, encodings, 
PropertyOperator?; multiple cache managers include VeryFastCache; expose cache
configuration parameters so administrators can tweak them

- Simplified configuration mechanism for Providers, Directives, Tools, Parsers

- Use broker to laod templates, property files

- Make LogFormat? configurable; allow logging to servlet log 

- Better error handling; filter exceptions through EvaluationExceptionHandler?, 
reset output when template evaluation throws so the user can see what happened

- CheckTemplate? tool, StreamTemplate? and TemplateDumper? tools

- ANT build support

- JUnit test framework

- More defaults so its harder to misconfigure WM

- performance enhancements

- Improved block syntax -- #if .. #else .. #endif

- Do arithmetic as int instead of long

- Allow access to .length field of arrays

- TemplatePath? is now optional; you can run WM with an empty .properties

- Load settings from system properties and web.xml as well as .properties
