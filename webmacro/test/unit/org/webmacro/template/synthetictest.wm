This test when run successfully, produces no output except whitespace.
This test has one variable, $home, which must be modified to run
on your host.

This is a synthetic test emulating
all essential features of WM. Its serves
multiple purposes. First, it excercises
all the core features of WM and acts as 
a general regression test. Second, it can
be used to test new features. Third, and
principally, this is a load test. Are there
any bottlenecks. In other words, WM is as
strong as its weakest link. synthetictest.wmt
exposes that link in conjunction with java profiling
tools.

synthetictest.wmt depends on synthetictest.java

## test include which includes a zero length file using the provided home property
#set $home = "/release/webmacro/test/unit"
#include "$home/org/webmacro/template/load/0.wm"

## test parsing the file:
#parse "org/webmacro/template/load/0.wm"

## test set:
#set $dir = "org/webmacro/template/load"
#set $file = "0.wm"

## test include and parse using variable references
#include "$(home)/$(dir)/$(file)"
#parse "$(dir)/$(file)"
#include "$home/$dir/$file"
#parse "$dir/$file"

##
## test introspection on $item a properties element
## and conditional evaluation

#set $item = "ATestValue"
#if ($item == "ATestValue") {
	#parse "org/webmacro/template/load/0.wm"
}
#else {
	Runtime Failure: on line 49, \$item failed to evaluate
}

## iteration testing

#set $list = ["one", "two", "three"]

#set $counter = 0
#foreach $element in $list indexing $index from 0 limit 1 {
	#set $counter = $counter + 1
	#if ($counter != 1) {
		Runtime Failure: on line 70, iteration limit was 1
	}
	#if ($index != 0) {
		Runtime Failure: on line 74, index was not zero
	}
}

#set $counter = 0
#alternate $color through [ "red", "blue", "green" ]
#foreach $element in $list indexing $index  from 0 limit 3 {
	#set $counter = $counter + 1
	#set $itemColor = $color
}
#if ($counter != 3 || $itemColor != "green") {
	Runtime Failure: on line 81, iteration or alternate did not perform properly.
	$counter should be 3
	$color should be green
}

## the text command
#text {
}

##
## executes the optional load feature of the synthetic test
#if ($runLoad) {
	#set $target = "$dir"
	#foreach $template in $load {
		#parse "$dir/$template"
	}
}
