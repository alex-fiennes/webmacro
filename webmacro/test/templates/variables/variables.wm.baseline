these should all say pass.  In other words, rouge variable references 
should *never* evaluate to true:

        NotInContext: pass
     VoidMethod call: pass
     NullMethod call: pass
      BadMethod call: pass
         BadProperty: pass
ThrowsException call: pass
               false: pass
                true: pass
