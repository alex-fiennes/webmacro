these should all say "pass":

        NotInContext: pass
     VoidMethod call: pass
     NullMethod call: pass
      BadMethod call: pass
         BadProperty: pass
ThrowsException call: pass
               false: pass
                true: pass

Personally, I believe that VoidMethod, BadMethod, and ThrowsException
should output a <!-- warning --> message, not "pass" or "fail"
