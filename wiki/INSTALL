                      Installing WebMacro's Wiki


System Requirements
-------------------

- Java 1.2 or better.  1.3.1 preferred
- a JSDK 2.x compatible servlet container
- WebMacro 0.98p1 or better
- ANT 1.3 or better (for building) (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/)


Building Wiki
-------------

Building has been made as simple as possible thanks to ANT.  But
before you can build Wiki, you need to set a few configuration
options.


Configuration
-------------

First, you need to decide where you are going to install Wiki.
This is important because it is this directory where Wiki will
store it's full-text index, pages, and users.

Once you've decided, open ./build.xml and change the value of
the first defined property to the install directory:

   <property name="dir.install"   value="/usr/local/wiki" />


Compiling
---------

Now that you've configured Wiki, you need to compile it.

> ant compile

This will compile all the source files and build 2 jar files
in the current directory:  wiki.jar and wiki-resources.jar.
You don't actually need to do anything with these, but they are
there incase you like to snoop.


Installing
----------

Okay, since Wiki is compiled, just do this:

> ant install

Wiki is now installed into the directory you set in build.xml.
The directory structure will look something like this:

/usr/local/wiki/
               /deploy/
                      /site-style.css
                      /images/
                             /*.gif
                      /WEB-INF/
                              /web.xml
                              /Wiki.properties
                              /lib/
                                  /*.jar

Next you need to tell your servlet container about
the web-app.


Configuring Resin 
-----------------

Edit your resin.conf file and set the "app-dir" for your <http-server>
to "/usr/local/wiki/deploy":

   <http-server app-dir='/usr/local/wiki/deploy'>
        ... other resin options here ...
   </http-server>

Restart Resin, and point your browser to:

http://localhost/WebMacro
                     

Configuring Tomcat

I have no idea.  Would somebody like to contribute?
