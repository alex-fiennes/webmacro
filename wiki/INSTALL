                      Installing WebMacro's Wiki


System Requirements
-------------------

- Java 1.2 or better.  1.3.1 preferred
- a JSDK 2.x compatible servlet container
- WebMacro 0.98p1 or better
- ANT 1.4 or better (for building) (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/)

Installing
----------

Before you can install Wiki, you need to make 2 decisions:
   1) what directory to install in?
   2) which Wiki site to install?


Once you've decided, simply run ant install:

> ant install -Ddir.install=<answer to 1> -Dsite.name=<answer to 2>

for example, to install the default wiki and wm servers:
ant install -Ddir.install=/deploy/wikiserver -Dsite.name=www.defaultserver.org

ant install -Ddir.install=/deploy/webmacro -Dsite.name=www.webmacro.org

Be sure to use unix style directory delimiters which work fine on MS
platforms.

If you fail to specify either -D parameter, ant will tell you about it!

This will install the specified Wiki site to the specified installation 
directory.  If you chose /usr/local/wiki as the install directory, you
should end put with a directory structure similiar to this:


/usr/local/wiki/
               /deploy/
                      /site-style.css
                      /images/
                             /*.gif
                      /WEB-INF/
                              /web.xml
                              /Wiki.properties
                              /lib/
                                  /*.jar



The next step is telling your servlet runner about it's new web-app.


Configuring Resin 
-----------------

Edit your resin.conf file and set the "app-dir" for your <http-server>
to "/usr/local/wiki/deploy":

   <http-server app-dir='/usr/local/wiki/deploy' />


Wiki comes preconfigured with a WEB-INF/ directory and a web.xml file
that should handle everything for you.

Once you've setup the new webapp, restart Resin, and point your 
browser to:

http://localhost/StartPage


You should see a page that says something like
   "The page StartPage does not exist, but that's okay!  You
can create it by clicking here".

Before you can create the page, you do need to register yourself
with the site.  So click the "Register" link in the top-left of the
web-page.

After you've registered yourself, you are free to create pages and to
start building your Wiki!

                     

Configuring Tomcat
------------------

I have no idea.  Would somebody like to contribute?  It should be
very similiar to Configuring Resin above.
