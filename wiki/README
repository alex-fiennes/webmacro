                       WebMacro's Wiki
                         Version 2.0

What is is?
-----------

WebMacro's Wiki is a Java-based website that allows it's users to create
and link the content.  It is loosely based off of the original Wiki:
   http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki


Why does it exist? 
------------------

It exists because the developers of WebMacro are very lazy!  We refuse
to maintain megabytes of static .html documentation for WebMacro.  Wiki
allows us, and our users, to update WebMacro's documentation "on the fly."


Who's responsible for this?
---------------------------

WebMacro's Wiki is mostly developed and maintained by Eric Ridge.  Lane
Sharman and Justin Wells have had major input into the code.  Wiki uses
Lane's VeryLargeHashtable as a storage medium for the pages and users.

Eric can be reached at ebr@tcdi.com.
Lane can be reached at lane@san.rr.com.
Justin can't ever seem to be reached.  If you find him, please let me
know.


How do I make this thing run?
-----------------------------

Getting Wiki up and running is fairly strightforward.  Just read the
INSTALL file.


What license does WebMacro's Wiki use?
--------------------------------------

Wiki is covered under a dual GPL/MPL license.  Hopefully this will work
just fine for you.  If not, please let me know.
